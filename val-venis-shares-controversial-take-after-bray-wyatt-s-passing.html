Val Venis on the other hand, had his own takeaway from this tragic story.</p><p>Val Venis heard this report about Bray Wyatt’s passing, and he went on an unhinged rant after he read Sean Sapp reveal Windham Rotunda’s cause of death.</p><p>As the Fightful reporter noted on the day that Bray Wyatt’s passing broke, “Windham Rotunda (Bray Wyatt) got COVID that exacerbated a heart issues. There was a lot of positive progress towards a return and his recovery. Unfortunately, today he suffered a heart attack and passed away.” Sean Sapp also made sure to note that, “I was given permission to reveal” the information.</p><p>Val Venis saw this tweet, and he went off. The former WWE Superstar posted on X to say, “100% COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE REPORTING BY THIS LOSER @SeanRossSapp! HORRIBLE REPORTING DRIVING MULTIPLE COMMENTS/QUOTES SUGGESTING PEOPLE GET THE CLOT SHOT! EVIL!”</p><p>Val Venis included a couple of screenshots with this tweet that had a few controversial takes to support his view. We will not be embedding that post in this article.</p><p>That post from Val Venis was not all. He also dropped a post later on that said, “I am only concerned with his reporting. That vaccine is dangerous. To watch a human being push others to get the vax is something I will always stand against.”</p><p>Val Venis did not stop there.<a href=#> His right-wing views are seen as extreme</a> by some, and he has been quite vocal about his anti-vaxxing views. This also got <a href=#>him in some trouble on social media,</a> as his account has been suspended in the past.</p><p>“Lots of delusional @SeanRossSapp rats (gender neutral term) talking smack. Pretty sure most of them are fully vaxxed & boosted. You would find plenty of pronouns in their bios. No more needs to be said. If you read this, please say a prayer for these leftist delusionals.”</p><p>The Big Valbowski also posted a bit later to carry on his narrative. He is not backing down, either, as he continues speaking about his views against the COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>Val Venis also noted on X to say that Bray Wyatt was a creative genius. His complaint had nothing to do with Bray Wyatt, but the fact that his story could be used to convince people to get a vaccine.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What’s your take on what Val Venis said?
