As much as the message of forgiveness, healing is a part of the gospel. christianpost.com/news/beni-john…</p><p style=text-align:justify>Every cancer death is heartbreaking, and we should pray for the bereaved. We should also pray that God may use Beni’s passing to awaken Bill Johnson to the dangers of the false gospel he has been preaching for so long.
