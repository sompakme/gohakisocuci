At 37, Hendy had already lived a long and rough life. Raised by an alcoholic mother, she was often left to go hungry as a child. There were several abusive men that her mother became involved with, resulting in a young Hendy seeing her mother physically assaulted. One stepfather made his way into Hendy's bed one night when she was only 12 years old and attempted to rape her. Rather than have her husband prosecuted, her mother threw the pre-teen out of the house, forcing her into a life where she lived with drug dealers and became a sex worker to survive.</p><p>Her interest in sadistic sex acts began to form around this time. One partner later recalled that Hendy had told him of a fantasy that involved them kidnapping and raping a sex worker.&nbsp;</p><p>As an adult, Hendy didn't fare much better than her mother. She bore three children, all with different fathers. Unable or unwilling to be a parent to them, she sent all three away to live with their grandparents when the youngest child was 10.&nbsp;</p><p>Free of her children and away from the abusive boyfriend she left behind in Washington, Hendy quickly became involved with Ray. Though 20 years his junior, she forged a relationship with Ray and the couple was soon living together in the small town of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. It was here that Ray divulged his sexual deviances to Hendy, leading to her involvement in horrific acts against young women.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j3Bob25lZMSprdNmn5qooJq7prCMraZmrJiaerW72GaZqLBdoLatuMSrqmaZk5i8rrzLopqeZZOeu6XFjKGcp5ypZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-brady-s-life-after-gisele-who-will-take-the-victoria-s-secret-angel-s-spot-as-qb-s-love-interes.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Brady's life after Gisele: Who will take the Victoria's Secret Angel's spot as QB's love interes</span></a>
