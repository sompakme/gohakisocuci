Quavo starts out by spitting, “She said I hurt her feelings 52 times (Two),” which is in reference to Nicki telling Zane Lowe she was hurt by the whole "Motorsport" fiasco. He the continues on mentioning Nicki’s name and referencing their collab “For Keeps,” among other things.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=s1>“Call up queen (Nicki)</span><br>The queen can't flex on a young bull (Flex)<br>Made her scream (Scream)<br>Chanel, I bought her two of 'em<br>You can check IG (Hey, IG)<br>'Cause when she post, it go up (Go)<br>Is she for keeps?

And if that’s still not enough, Quavo also references Nicki’s name later in the verse, actually flipping Drake’s "In My Feelings" and spitting, "Nicki, Nicki, do you love me? (Please)/Why you crying? (Why?)."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=s1>Take a listen to the song for yourself (below) and be sure to check out some of the reactions from fans on twitter as well.</span></p><p>Quavo Appears To Address His Alleged Relationship With Nicki Minaj On “Huncho Dreams”</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Kevin Goddard is an editor for HNHH.
