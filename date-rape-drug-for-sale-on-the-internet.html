<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Date-rape drug for sale on the internet</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The date-rape drug rohypnol, a tranquilliser banned from sale in Britain, is one of scores of prescription drugs that can be bought openly for a few pounds on the internet.</p><p>The array of drugs available from the billion-pound web-based industry also includes valium, diazepam, prozac and viagra. All that is needed is a keyboard and credit card.</p><p>It is not illegal to buy the drugs in this country, but foreign firms are breaking British law by selling them. All the British authorities can do is inform their counterparts abroad.</p><p>During an investigation by BBC1's Six O'Clock News 10 rohypnol tablets, known as "roofies", were bought for £60 from one of the sites on which they were advertised. They arrived a few days later from Thailand.</p><p>Rohypnol gained notoriety after court cases revealed how <a href=# lang=en.uk>rapists would drop the sleeping pill into their victim's drink</a>, rendering them unconscious for up to 12 hours.</p><p>When the BBC ordered the drug, there were no medical checks. Dr Robert Lefever, of the Promis Recovery Centre, an addiction treatment unit, says ordering prescription drugs from the internet could be fatal.</p><p>"We need to have a clear picture of what the patient is on," he said. "Otherwise, I could prescribe something today and if you hadn't told me you had had this from the internet, heaven knows what could happen.</p><p>"There are pages of drug inter-reactions that we have to be familiar with or that we have to look up on the computer. So just to take drugs off the net is very dangerous."</p><p>The BBC team sent the rohypnol pills to a laboratory where tests indicated that they were genuine.</p><p>The pharmaceutical company Roche, which manufactures both rohypnol and valium, is increasingly concerned at the growth in internet pharmacies.</p><p>A spokesman said: "Roche does not sell its products over the internet and takes the unauthorised supply and use of all its prescription medicines very seriously.</p><p>"It is important that these medicines are taken only as directed, following proper professional consultation - it is totally inappropriate for prescription medicines to be illegally advertised and sold over the internet.</p><p>"We are looking at ways to prevent these sites from promoting and selling our prescription medicines directly to the public. However, they often operate in regions where the regulatory responsibility is not clear and powers not easily enforced."</p><p>The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Products Agency, an agency within the Department of Health, is responsible for cracking down on internet drug dealers. They receive around a dozen reports of illegal websites every month.</p><p>British-registered websites must have a qualified medical practitioner who assesses and signs off all prescription applications before the drugs are dispatched, and the medicines must come under the usual licensing restrictions.</p><p>But the MHRA has no powers overseas, where some drugs that need a prescription in Britain are available over the counter.</p><p>"Obviously there is a problem where the sale of some medicines is outside the jurisdiction of the UK," said an MHRA spokesman.</p><p>"However, other countries are also concerned about the risk to public health and we work closely with other regulatory authorities in the European Union and the US.</p><p>"MHRA will investigate the companies in this [BBC] report. Any company operating abroad is outside the jurisdiction of the MHRA, but the details will be passed on to the relevant authorities in Thailand."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwwcqnnLCrX2aBd32WcW1ofJGpsm6%2BwKmcZpyiqrRuss6rZKyZnJp6sLqMrZ%2BeZZmjwaa%2BzZ6rZ6Ckork%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bow-wow-let-me-hold-you-lyrics.html><span>←</span><span>Bow wow let me hold you lyrics</span></a>
