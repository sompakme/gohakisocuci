His songs like the No. 1 PLATINUM hit “</span><a href=# data-rel=lightbox-video-0><b>There Was This Girl</b></a><span style=font-weight:400>,” the 2X-PLATINUM-certified heart-tugger “</span><a href=# data-rel=lightbox-video-1><b>I Wish Grandpas Never Died</b></a><span style=font-weight:400>” (which he performed live at the 55th ACM Awards), and his chart-topping collab with Thomas Rhett, “</span><a href=# data-rel=lightbox-video-2><b>Half of Me</b></a><span style=font-weight:400>,” have made Riley synonymous with what Country music does best: making listeners </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>feel</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> something with his no-gimmick, relatable writing and classic feel. An avid sports fan, former athlete (Jacksonville State University quarterback) and outdoorsman, Riley is riding a wave of success after being named the Academy of Country Music’s 2020 New Male Artist of the Year, a former </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>MusicRow</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> Breakout Artist of the Year, a CMT “Listen Up Artist,” and one of CRS’s 2020 New Faces.

Yet even as he continues to release music and tour, the CMA and ACM award winner’s ambitions have also extended to numerous media and charity projects. In recent years, Lawrence has hosted the radio show “Honky Tonkin’ with Tracy Lawrence,” which currently airs in more than 170 markets. His interest in working with younger artists and being able to explore different topics led to the “TL’s Road House” podcast, which has featured such guests as HARDY, Jelly Roll and Lainey Wilson.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After revisiting his catalog with the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Hindsight 2020 Vol 1, 2, </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>3</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Live at Billy Bob’s Texas</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> albums, Lawrence is gearing up to return to the studio. Meantime, the most important part of his work has become the Mission:Possible non-profit benefiting the homeless: From its humble beginnings cooking Thanksgiving dinners for the Nashville Rescue Mission, the organization has raised more than $2.5M for this important cause. Lawrence’s philanthropic efforts were honored with the 2023 CRS Humanitarian Award.</span></p><p><b>About Ella Langley:</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ella Langley’s music kicks like a smooth Alabama whiskey. Her dyed-in-the-wool country storytelling and anthemic hooks go down easy, while moments of attitude-laden rock ‘n’ roll might just knock you on the floor. The singer and songwriter distills her honest experiences and formative inspirations into an intoxicating and inimitable brew of her own. Hailing from Hope Hull, Alabama, she tirelessly gigged in bars and at local festivals before relocating to Nashville in 2019. She quietly built an audience on social media with a series of singles. Her songs “If You Have To” (2021), “Damn You” (2022), and “Country Boy’s Dream Girl” (2022) have continuously fueled her momentum with tens of millions of streams on each track. Simultaneously, she landed high-profile cuts behind-the-scenes. She co-wrote Elle King’s 2022 single “Out Yonder” in addition to four more tracks on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Come Get Your Wife</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. As a formidable performer, she toured with the likes of Koe Wetzel, Randy Houser, Cody Johnson, and Jamey Johnson in addition to sharing the stage with Lainey Wilson and Parker McCollum. Meanwhile, she made her debut at the Grand Ole Opry, and Spotify pegged her as a </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>“Hot Country Artist to Watch for 2023</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span><i><span style=font-weight:400>”</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> Flexing showstopping vocals, a razor-sharp pen, and no filter whatsoever, she’s quietly emerged as a phenomenon with tens of millions of streams and a growing fan base. She formally introduced her signature style on her 2023 debut EP, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Excuse The Mess</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> [Columbia Records/Sony Music Nashville], which features current rising single “</span><a href=# data-rel=lightbox-video-3><span style=font-weight:400>That’s Why We Fight</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>” [feat. Koe Wetzel]. She is set to hit the road supporting Jon Pardi on his </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mr. Saturday Night World Tour</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> for the remainder of the year.</span></p><p><b>About Live Nation Entertainment</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE: LYV) is the world’s leading live entertainment company comprised of global market leaders: Ticketmaster, Live Nation Concerts, and Live Nation Sponsorship.
