That’s where they found a white pick up truck had crashed into the back of a red car, sending the red car into the front of the building.&nbsp;</p><p>“We initially got called for a traffic crash,” said Jeffrey Bladel, Assistant Chief of Davenport Police. “But upon arrival they determined it was more than just a crash. It involved a disturbance, possible road rage incident…there could be a number of different charges. And again they’re going to have to review the full case, review everything they can and then go from there.” &nbsp;</p><p>The incident was caught on video, which an employee uploaded to YouTube, hoping to catch those responsible. The surveillance video is uploaded as two parts, totaling around 14 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>In the video a man is seen leaving Brady Mart and getting into a white pick up truck. He then starts arguing with someone in a dark colored car. The white pick up truck leaves the scene, almost crashing into a red car in the lot. The video shows two women exchanging words before getting into a physical fight.</p><p>The white pick up truck returns a short time later and slams into the back of the red car, which was parked at the time,&nbsp;sending it into the front of the building.&nbsp;</p><p>A small child can be seen in the back seat of the red car as it crashes into the building.</p><p>The crash results in a fight between at least four individuals seen in the video.</p><p>Davenport Police say the suspect(s) fled the scene before they arrived, and no one is in custody at this time.&nbsp;</p><p>Police say no one was injured.&nbsp;</p><p>On Monday Tawni Peters, the General Manager of Brady Mart, says this needs to be taken seriously, and they hope their camera footage will help catch those responsible.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s very frustrating because you know, when you work hard to have nice things or to own a business, and to be part of the community, and then to have something like this happen is very detrimental,” said Peters.&nbsp;“It’s damaging. And it’s frustrating because you put so much money and hard work into something and then in a matter of seconds it’s damaged.”&nbsp;</p><p>Peters says she was very disturbed when she noticed the child in the surveillance video.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think in anybody’s mind, there’s an innocent child involved,” said Peters. “It could’ve been a lot worse than it was, but it is sad to see that somebody’s child was in the backseat of a car, not only during the wreck but prior to that, that witnessed everything and that’s not.. I don’t think anybody wants their children to be exposed to that so the whole situation was just very disheartening, very sad.”</p><p>Anyone with information regarding this incident is encouraged to call the Davenport Police Department at 563 326-6125 or submit an anonymous tip via the mobile app entitled&nbsp; “CityConnect Davenport, IA” or “CrimeReports by Motorola”.</p><p>Here is the raw security video in two parts:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.ourquadcities.com/nxsglobal/ourquadcities/photo/2018/06/11/cartruckCapture_1528751409443_45157525_ver1.0_640_360.JPG> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.ourquadcities.com/nxsglobal/ourquadcities/photo/2018/06/11/Raw_video__Altercation_at_Brady_Mart_0_45155246_ver1.0_640_360.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46bqZqcqWK6or7TZqSappGcsrN50pqwrGWnmrKssc2dZJyqkai1brXSZp%2BemaKpr7OxwKSgp59f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-paul-biography-age-height-boyfriend-net-worth-brother.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Paul Biography, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Brother</span></a>
