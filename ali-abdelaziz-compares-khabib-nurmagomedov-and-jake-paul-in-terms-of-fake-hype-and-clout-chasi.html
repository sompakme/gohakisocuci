Ali was on ESPN talking to Brett Okamoto when he dropped the statement. Khabib’s former manager turned promoter Ali said “Khabib is not into clout, he’s very truthful in what he says and not like Jake Paul and these other fake guys”.</p><p>It is not often that Jake Paul and Khabib Nurmagomedov’s names get said in the same breath. The two celebrities are polar opposites of one another. Khabib is a reserved, truthful and honest champion while Jake Paul is a boisterous, clout chasing YouTuber turned “Boxer”.</p><p>Ali Abdelaziz has history with Jake Paul and not a friendly one. Just a few days ago, <a href=#>Jake Paul called Ali a “Scumbag Criminal”</a> in an interview. It is safe to say that Ali and Paul do not like each other. Ali clapped back at Paul calling him a fake “clout chaser”.</p><p></p><p>Ironically, Ali himself has been called a clout chaser by fans and MMA personalities alike. Ali has been in verbal scuffles with the likes of Colby “Chaos” Covington and Conor McGregor in the past. He has been accused of taking over the twitter handles of the fighters he manages to start fights and rows with other fighters. A lot of people have criticized him for his tactics and criminal past.</p><p>Ali was in the swimming pool when he was giving the interview to Brett, a fact which the latter pointed out would stir up MMA fans.</p><p>But to mention Jake Paul’s name in an interview where he was not even relevant is clout chasing in and on itself on the part of Ali Abdelaziz!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmmqSZYq6jsMSlmLOhqmKwsLnPmqmeq12gtaKuyJtkp62ioq6ou8yem6iuXZa7pXnJmqKeZaCWwq15yKdkrZ2iosBuu8VmnZqjlWK1urzEZpinnF2YubDB02aaoZmjnruoew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./16-shows-like-gossip-girl-to-watch-next.html><span>←</span><span>16 Shows like 'Gossip Girl' to Watch Next</span></a>
