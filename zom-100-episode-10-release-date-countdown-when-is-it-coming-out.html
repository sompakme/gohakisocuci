In this article we provide all this and more – so keep reading to get all the key information for Episode 10.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Episode 10 Release Schedule</h2><p>Unfortunately, Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead Episode 10 may take longer than anticipated to debut. As with previous episodes, Episode 10 can be streamed on Crunchyroll, Netflix and Hulu; however, unfortunately there has been disappointing news – airing of Episodes 9, 10 and 11 have been postponed indefinitely leaving fans in suspense as there has been no official notification regarding a specific return date for Zom 100.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Recap of Zom 100: Bucket List Of The Dead Episode 9 – “Treehouse of the Dead”</h2><p>In Episode 9 of Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead, titled “Treehouse of the Dead,” Akira and his friends finally reach Akira’s village, only to find the entrance barricaded to keep zombies out. They are forced to venture into the wilderness, where they encounter Masaru Kumano, an elderly man constructing a treehouse to escape zombie boars. Akira convinces his group to help Kumano with another item on their bucket list. During this process, Akira learns that Kumano had to make the heartbreaking decision to kill his own son after he turned into a zombie. This revelation intensifies Akira’s determination to find a way to repay his parents.</p><p>Upon reuniting with his parents in the village, Akira takes it upon himself to assist them by taking over their tasks. However, his parents do not see it as a burden and continue working despite their old age. This leaves Akira pondering how he can adequately show his gratitude towards them. In the midst of this, a cynical survivor named Kanta Higurashi from Tokyo arrives, accompanied by his own group of survivors, with the intention of releasing the zombies in the village.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meet Zom 100: Bucket List Of The Dead’s New Villain – Kanta Higurashi</h2><p>While not much has been revealed about the new antagonist in Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead, Kanta Higurashi is shaping up to be the polar opposite of Akira. Both Akira and Kanta have found a sense of liberation in the midst of the zombie apocalypse and have their own bucket lists of things they want to do before succumbing to the infection. However, their motivations diverge significantly. While Akira seeks enjoyment and personal fulfillment, Kanta desires vengeance against the world for what he perceives as his personal exclusion from society. These two characters are clearly meant to contrast each other, setting the stage for intriguing interactions when the series returns.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Here’s a summary of the information</h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tr><th>Release Schedule for Episode 10</th><th>Recap of Episode 9</th><th>New Villain – Kanta Higurashi</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Indefinitely postponed</td><td>Akira and friends reach his village, encounter Kumano</td><td>Kanta is the polar opposite of Akira</td></tr><tr><td>Streaming on Crunchyroll, Netflix, and Hulu</td><td>Kumano’s tragic past revealed</td><td>Kanta seeks vengeance</td></tr><tr><td>Awaiting updates on the return date</td><td>Akira reunites with his parents</td><td>Intriguing character dynamics</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Introduction of a cynical survivor, Kanta</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Suspenseful developments for the season finale</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>As we eagerly await the return of Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead, it’s clear that Episode 10 is poised to deliver an action-packed conclusion to the season, with the clash between Akira and Kanta at the center of the excitement.
