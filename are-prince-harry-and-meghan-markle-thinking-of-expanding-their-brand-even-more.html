According to <a href=#>The Daily Mail</a>, the 30-year-old brand guru has helped "X-Factor" judge Nicole Scherzinger expand her brand successfully and land "lucrative deals." Ayling&nbsp;has been a full-time consultant with the "X-Factor" judge for over seven years. The young brand consultant has generated what appears to be consumer product deals for the singer and reality TV star, including yogurt commercials.</p><p>We have to wonder if the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are truly looking for commercial endorsements for consumer products. In late 2020, royal expert Katie Nicholl said she thought the Sussexes' business model would follow Barack and Michelle Obama's "Higher Ground" path.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>9Honey</a>,&nbsp;Nicholl said, "They are just emulating in each step of what they're doing and that is because the Obamas' model has worked. It's high end, it's aspirational, it sits very much with the image that the Sussexes are trying to curate for themselves and it's a successful business model. So why wouldn't they look to that for inspiration? I think that's exactly what they've done." Time will tell how the rest of the former royals' business model plays out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWtnaIV2e8CrnGaoop67pLGMoZirqqlirq%2BwjKacoKCRo3qurdGko55lpJ22r7fIp55mp5Zisrm8wKeboqaXYsGpscirZJuqkaOxbrHVnqVmpZ%2BnsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happens-if-you-paint-acrylic-over-oil.html><span>←</span><span>What happens if you paint acrylic over oil?</span></a>
