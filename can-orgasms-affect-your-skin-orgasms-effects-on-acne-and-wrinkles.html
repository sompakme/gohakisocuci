And for me, that means 15 minutes when my face doesn’t look acne-prone and irritated, but rather pure, flushed, and glowy.<br></p><p>In fact, I love my “sex skin” so much, that I set out to see if I could make it last forever (or, at the very least, longer than a&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;rerun). So after doing a little research and talking to a few experts to make sure my idea wasn’t totally crazy, I decided to conduct an experiment: 14 orgasms, seven days, and a whole bunch of selfies. Even if my test was a failure, I figured I’d at least end up with a happy ending—14 of them, to be exact.</p><h2 id=could-it-really-work-3>Could It Really Work?</h2><p>I’d like to clarify that I didn’t embark on this experiment blindly. The idea came from a book I read called&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GUIKYLA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01GUIKYLA%2Fref%3Ddp-kindle-redirect%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26btkr%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon>Pussy: A Reclamation</a>&nbsp;by Regena Thomashauer, in which Thomashauer, a “pleasure” advocate and the founder of&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://womanlyartsmastery.com/experience/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>The School of Womanly Arts</a>, writes, “I am a firm believer in the power of orgasm to fuel a woman’s radiance.” Sure, she meant “radiance” in the abstract, but my interests were still piqued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ysxb7iUwx9L5FYGhbjscCb-1920-80.jpg><p>After some deep-dive research,<strong>&nbsp;I did find a link between consistent orgasm and clearer, brighter, younger-look skin.&nbsp;</strong>In the ‘90s, Researcher David Weeks studied 3,500 people and found that&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://books.google.com/books/about/Superyoung.html?id=ztemHAAACAAJ" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>women who had three orgasms a week</a>&nbsp;looked, on average, 10 years younger than those who only had two. Furthermore, recent&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264051058_The_Neurophysiology_of_Orgasm referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>studies prove</a>&nbsp;that female orgasm releases hormones that benefit skin (like estrogen, which&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685269/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>helps maintain collagen</a>), lowers cortisol levels (the stress hormone that can wreak havoc on skin), and boosts blood circulation, which stimulates and repairs collagen. I started to think of orgasming as a really, really fun version of retinol.<br></p><p>I called Thomashauer to get her thoughts on my skin-clearing theory. “Actually, I had terrible acne into my thirties, and&nbsp;<strong>the only thing that impacted my skin was when I had an orgasm a day,</strong>” she says. “If I were to design an experiment for you, I would aim for two daily orgasms, because I think it evens out your skin chemistry in the most remarkable way.” (Note: There’s no science that actually says this, but hey, why not try it?)<br></p><p>My plan was to masturbate once in the morning and have sex with my husband once in the evening (which, I admit, was ambitious), but it was surprisingly hard to find a convenient time to experience so much pleasure. With family visiting, a facial scheduled (which would alter the appearance of my skin), and just feeling&nbsp;blah&nbsp;overall, it took a few false starts before I was finally (getting) off.</p><h2 id=the-big-o-experiment-3>The Big-O Experiment</h2><p>On day one, I made some notes in my journal: “Skin is a little dull, and there’s some scarring and redness, especially under my nose.” After my first (self-administered) orgasm, I checked the mirror immediately to note any changes. My cheeks had a nice, healthy flush—as was expected—but that was about it. A last-minute scheduling mix-up with my husband also meant that I was on my own again that night.<br></p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><p>The next day, I compared day two’s selfie to the previous. My skin was&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;a little glowier, right? Right?! But as the initial excitement wore off, I found it harder to fit two sessions into my day—<strong>I didn’t anticipate how much time actually goes into getting in the mood and working myself up to the orgasm</strong>, let alone setting time aside for sex. By the third morning, I journaled, “I don’t want to do this. I feel like I’m forcing myself.” But force myself I did, in the name of science.<br></p><p>On day four, I was pretty much over it. My skin was looking a bit brighter and calmer, but the work that went into orgasming was seriously stressing me out. And then, to top it off, my period started. I was totally taken by surprise.&nbsp;<strong>Usually, a smattering of cystic zits on my face is a sign that my period is coming, but during my experiment, I didn’t break out at all.&nbsp;</strong>This was revolutionary—did I just find the cure for zits?!<br></p><p>The thrill of my discovery didn’t last long. On days five and six, I could only manage one attempt at masturbation per day, proving you can turn&nbsp;anything&nbsp;into a chore. The final morning of my experiment, though, as I scrolled through my week’s worth of selfies, I felt shocking satisfaction: Compared to day one,&nbsp;<strong>my seventh-day skin was noticeably less inflamed, sported fewer pimples, and looked definitively flushed and glowy</strong>. It was hard to notice a change day to day, but from start to finish the pictures didn’t lie—my skin looked, well, better.</p><h2 id=what-was-actually-happening-3>What Was Actually Happening</h2><p>Seeing as this experiment was completely biased, uncontrolled, and not-at-all scientific, I was afraid that my results could partially be a placebo effect. So I consulted a dermatologist to get a professional opinion.&nbsp;Am I crazy?&nbsp;“No,” says Jennifer Vickers, M.D., of&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.sanovadermatology.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Sanova Dermatology</a>&nbsp;in Texas. Though Dr. Vickers admits orgasms, particularly women's orgasms, are not well studied, she was able to validate some of my findings.</p><p>“Orgasming causes your brain to trigger an oxytocin release,” she says, noting that the oxytocin (which is a happy, feel-good hormone)&nbsp;<strong>lowers cortisol levels, leads to better sleep, helps the skin heal itself, and decreases inflammation in the body.</strong>&nbsp;And while orgasming can’t necessarily reverse the effects of stress on the skin, Dr. Vickers speculates that it may stop stress-related skin disorders from flaring up in the first place.</p><p>At this point you may be thinking,&nbsp;If orgasms are so good for my skin, why haven’t I heard about this before?&nbsp;“Because orgasms are free,” says Thomashauer. “In this culture, if it’s not tied to a product, it’s not really promoted.” It’s also likely due to the fact that the benefits of orgasms are, sadly, only temporary. Hormone levels even out after the initial post-O glow, so in order for your skin to reap any long-term benefits,&nbsp;<strong>your orgasm routine needs to be a consistent—like, at-least-once-a-day consistent.</strong><br></p><p>Still, based on how my skin looks now, I feel like it’s my duty—both as a woman and as a skincare-obsessed citizen of the world—to do my part to make “sex skin” a lifelong look. While I can’t guarantee that consistent orgasm will entirely rid you of acne or wrinkles, I&nbsp;can&nbsp;guarantee that it’s arguably more fun (and way less expensive) than a trip to the dermatologist.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJqVlsK1xY6aaWxvYmx%2BeYCOqKmgmaOierS3yKdknp6WmrC1v44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ateez-wooyoung-s-biting-sign-stirs-up-vata-s-new-thing-plagiarism-talks-online-again.html><span>←</span><span>ATEEZ Wooyoung's 'biting' sign stirs up VATAs New Thing plagiarism talks online again</span></a>
