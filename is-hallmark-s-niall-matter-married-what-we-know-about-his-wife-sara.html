She is reportedly a businesswoman and entrepreneur in Canada, where she and Niall are from. But other than that, not much is known about the couple's romance. However, now and then, the "When I Think of Christmas" actor will share glimpses of his relationship with Sara on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>In 2018, the actor teased how he and his wife crossed paths when responding to a tweet by co-star <a href=#>Candace Cameron Bure</a>, who said Niall had the "best story" on how he met Sara. He <a href=#>replied</a>, "Hahaha!! I was getting nervous there. It was AMAZING working alongside you @candacecbure. It's a real life mystery and some very serious sleuthing skills led me to the woman who is now my wife. True Story!" Although he didn't divulge the story, it must have been amazing if Bure thought it was the best.</p><p>A year later, in 2019, Niall shared the sweet nickname his wife gave him because of his holiday spirit both on and off-screen. He <a href=#>tweeted</a>, "Well, I have much more up around here then just a wreath... spent most of the day getting the tree perfected. My wife called me Mr. Christmas if that's any indication." Despite fans not knowing much about their relationship, it's clear they have a playful connection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxlbYV6hI6iqmagkaG5rq3RpGSsrJGneq%2B1wKWjZqWRqcGmvoymmKuqmZqxbsPIn5xmq5GnrnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./idi-amin-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Idi Amin Net Worth</span></a>
