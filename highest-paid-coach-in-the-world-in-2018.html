The team’s victory can be achieved only with the collective striving of its participants towards a common goal. Only with the help of individual efforts of each team member, friendly general atmosphere, the feeling of empathy and support a team gets the victory. One of the factors contributing to the achievement of a group goal is the authority of the trainer. That is why the most successful teams always hire the best coaches who fairly worth it.

It was in 1975, and it was a usual $25-per-week position of an assistant to Baltimore Colts head coach Ted Marchibroda. How did it happen? Bill got an excellent football education, but his football career in college did not work, and he was hired to work in the Baltimore Colts as an errand boy! In Detroit and Denver, he was given the nickname “genius” and “punk” for his defiant approach and extraordinary vision of the game.</p><p class=align-left>In New York, Bill Parcells called him "a scowling pessimist," laughing at his rude demeanour and monotonous voice. In the 1990s, he was known as the "lame duck" because of those sad years in Cleveland. And in 1999, after he worked in the Jets for less than a day, he managed to call himself the head coach of the New York team in a note about his resignation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4ee5b4ef568c4ab9.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How much is Dana White worth?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/37fc02c73a3c3b97.png><p class=align-left>Over the past 17 seasons in New England, he got: fourteen divisional titles — eight of them in a row, twenty-six victories in the playoffs (NFL record), seven titles of the AFC conference champions and five Super Bowls. So who is the highest paid coach in the world?</p><p class=align-left>We all know him as Bill Belichick — world highest paid coach <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">according to Forbes</a>. There is no doubt that he is worth his annual professional sports coach salary of $7.5 million. Besides, his net worth is estimated at $35 million! Bill`s income did not grow gradually. He managed to multiply the amount of the money he got from $25-per-week to crazy $10,000 only for one year in Detroit due to his persistence (according to the book The Education of a Coach<i> </i>by David Halberstam).</p><p class=align-left>Moreover, every victory brings more money to a coach and the whole team, and Belichick won over 72% of his games since 2000 when he became the coach of New England. On the Internet, you can often see Bill`s life credo “Do your job (well).” It is definitely the answer to the question about the ways he has earned his money.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fe0c85460d2aa04f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Richest football players in the world in 2018</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In many interviews with his players and colleagues, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Belichick is described</a> as a respectable and trustworthy personality; his imagery even became a popular Internet meme about strictness and coolness. The players of his team dress up in Bill Belichick costume for Halloween, his fans depict him on the iron throne (from The Game of Thrones), the critics are just unable to make up the top ten of his fails, and the presidents of the USA text with him not about politics. This person has reached not only the position of the highest paid coach in the world but also the position of the most respectable and loved coach and friend.</p><p></p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Top 10 highest paid footballers in the world in 2018</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnN%2Bj3JsbGWYnrSpsdKtZKmZmZl6pLvAnJ9mr5%2BnuaV5kWlocWaYqbqt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dope-bible-quotes-to-get-the-youngsters-into-reading-the-good-book.html><span>←</span><span>Dope Bible quotes to get the youngsters into reading the Good Book</span></a>
