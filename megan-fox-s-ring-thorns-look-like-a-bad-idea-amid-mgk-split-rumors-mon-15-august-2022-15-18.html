However, MGK is currently on tour, which could be the reason for his absense on Megan’s Instagram feed.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Megan Fox (@meganfox)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=megans-engagement-ring-has-thorns-in-it>Megan’s engagement ring has thorns in it</h2><p>Fans have been feeling the pain from the breakup rumors, much like meg will be on her wedding ring finger as MGK revealed that the almond-shaped emerald and diamond engagement ring he proposed to Megan Fox, not only cost $340,000 but is designed to hurt like thorns if removed.</p><p>He recently told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vogue</a>, “The bands are actually thorns. So if she tries to take it off, it hurts.” This comes as MGK continues to portray his “love is pain” mentality.</p><p>Some people have been keen to point out that this ‘love is pain’ mentality could set a potentially harmful example for younger fans and doesn’t necessarily represent a “healthy relationship.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>megan fox when she tries to remove her engagement ring: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mjAol4Cuwo</a></p>— Stanky (@stankymma) <a href=#>January 20, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=fans-react-to-the-breakup-rumors%25c2%25a0>Fans react to the breakup rumors&nbsp;</h2><p>Most fans of the couple have been shocked by the rumors and are hoping they aren’t true.
