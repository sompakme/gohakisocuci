She said: "It's never too late to start. You can be the visionary of your own life… There is still so much work to be done. "I am a woman who remains inspired and driven by this organisation," she said, looking over Ms Steinem, who introduced her alongside current foundation chief executive Teresa Younger.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/24dfad5338a7-meghan-markle-prince-harry.jpg><p id=eDqD0IgNGD data-wc=46>"It allowed me to recognise that part of my greater value and purpose in life was to advocate for those who felt unheard, to stand up to injustice, and to not be afraid of saying what is true and what is just and what is right."&nbsp;</p><p id=ebU-VjonG7 data-wc=49>Tuesday’s event marked the first public event that Harry and Meghan have attended together since the duke made the solo trip to the King’s coronation earlier this month.
