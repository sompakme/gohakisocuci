With eight nominations under his belt, he had earned a reputation for being "always the bridesmaid, never the bride" until the Leonardo DiCaprio/Jack Nicholson vehicle <i>The Departed</i> brought him two gongs for best director and best film.&nbsp;</p><p id=eC6sg0TZkti data-wc=47>The Oscar trophies joined the three Baftas, two Golden Globes and host of other awards already adorning his mantelpiece. To say Martin has found his calling is something of an understatement, but the Queens-born talent seriously considered becoming a priest before realising his life belonged to cinema.</p><p id=e7oLYCdSew data-wc=49>&nbsp;An interest in spiritual issues shines through his silver screen work, with two religious-themed movies - <i>Kundun,</i> about the 14th Dalai Lama, and <i>The Last Temptation Of Christ</i> - among his most celebrated works. Also inspiring much of his output has been, perhaps unsurprisingly, the city of his birth.&nbsp;</p><p id=eNSy1hbQqY6 data-wc=50>Classics like <i>Mean Streets, Taxi Driver</i> and <i>Goodfellas</i> all explored the seedy underbelly of New York, while the more recent <i>Gangs Of New York</i> delved into its history. Another common feature is his fascination with Italian-American society, although a quick glance at his filmography reveals he's nothing if not versatile.&nbsp;</p><p id=e4cSqHNo5oZ data-wc=26>Thrillers like <i>Cape Fear,</i> romances such as <i>The Age Of Innocence</i> and bio-pics, including <i>Raging Bull</i> and <i>The Aviator</i>, all served as testament to his abilities.</p><h2>His personal life</h2><p id=eBBnwySsAzH data-wc=36>In the same way his career has taken many twists and turns, Martin's personal life has also been eventful. He has been married five times, first to actress Laraine Brennan, with whom he had a daughter.&nbsp;</p><p id=efRGS4kQ7Rw data-wc=33>Some years after that relationship came to an end he tied the knot with writer Julia Cameron, and welcomed another daughter, before making his vows a third time with the model Isabella Rossellini.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMfn78fqqQ data-wc=38>When his relationship with the Italian beauty broke down in 1982, he went on to wed producer Barbara DaFina. His current wife is TV producer Helen Morris, whom he wed in 1999. The couple have a daughter together.</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9wbmdkuqK%2B06KlZquTpL%2B0sdKeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kyrie-irving-reflects-on-his-time-in-boston-that-wasn-t-a-great-reflection-of-who-i-am.html><span>←</span><span>Kyrie Irving Reflects On His Time In Boston: &amp;quot;That Wasn't A Great Reflection Of Who I Am&amp;quot;</span></a>
