According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ComicBook</a>, the streamer recently premiered the official <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer </a>this past Thursday, and it looks to be a fun-filled family adventure the entire family can enjoy just in time for the holidays. Brace yourselves, however, as Momoa is definitely stepping out of his comfort zone in his latest flick, portraying a character far less intimidating than the ones we’re used to seeing from the actor.</p><p>The forthcoming Netflix feature is set to debut on the platform on November 18th, 2022, and Jason Momoa will portray a character named Flip, a magical companion who ushers a younger woman into an alternate dreamworld night after night. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">movie</a> is based on the comic book series Little Nemo in Slumberland by author Winsor McCay. Going off the new trailer, audiences are in for a breathtaking spectacle with a heartfelt narrative.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jason-momoa-slumberland-1-900x506.jpg><p>Jason Mamoa, Kyle Chandler, Chris O’Dowd, Humberly Gonzalez, Mercedes Blanche, India de Beaufort, Marlow Barkley, and Ava Cheung star in the upcoming Netflix feature, which was helmed by Francis Lawrence and penned by Michael Handelman and David Guion from the comic book series by Winsore McCay. Slumberland was produced by Peter Chernin, David Ready, and Jenno Topping, with Ray Angelic, David Guion, and Michael Handelman serving as executive producers.</p><p>In the Netflix original, Flip (Jason Momoa) takes young Nemo (Marlow Barkley) on the adventure of a lifetime after her father is lost at sea. She is sent to reside with her incredibly strange uncle in the city, which turns her Pacific Northwest existence completely upside down. Although her time spent in school is trying, a secret map to the magical world of Slumberland introduces her to Flip, and the two travel across dreams, where Nemo hopes she can reunite with her father.</p><p>Jason Momoa was announced to star in Slumberland back in March 2020, with Netflix distributing and production scheduled to begin in the summer of the same year. Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, however, filming for the project was postponed. Filming on the project eventually began on February 18th, 2021, in Toronto and wrapped up on May 19th, 2021.</p><p>Judging by the trailer, we’ll be seeing Jason Momoa in an entirely different light come mid-November. Arguably known best for portraying Arthur Curry/Aquaman in various pictures connected to the DC Extended Universe, Momoa has frequently appeared in more adult-oriented features such as the motion picture Wolves, HBO’s wildly popular original series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of Thrones</a>, the movie Conan the Barbarian, and the TV-MA-rated television show Frontier. The actor looks to be treading in unusual territory with Slumberland, and we’re interested to see how his acting chops carry over into a more family-oriented feature.</p><p>At 43 years old, Jason Momoa has managed to become a household name in recent years, and it almost feels as if his career is just getting started. In addition to Slumberland, the actor is set to appear in The Last Manhunt, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast X</a>, which is the tenth installment in Universal’s high-grossing action franchise. Additionally, he’s rumored to have a role in an upcoming motion picture adaptation of the game Minecraft, as well as a remake of the 1993 thriller-ride Cliffhanger.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irlZp6q63SqKVmpZ%2BivKJ5yKetmpyVYrGzscCmqmahnmLArcHMm5yrpJGjsW%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sam-gores-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Sam Gores Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
