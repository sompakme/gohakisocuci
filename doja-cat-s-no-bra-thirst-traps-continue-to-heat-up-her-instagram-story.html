From stating that the project is "French conceptual experimental country/bohemian fusion with the essence of blue-grass," to asserting that she's planning to "quit music" due to the negativity it's bringing into her life, the Planet Her hitmaker's Twitter feed has been all over the place as of late. Thankfully, things are much clearer on Doja's Instagram page, where she's had followers drooling over her not-so-subtle thirst traps.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The salacious snapshots show off the 27-year-old's recently altered breasts, which she previously said are now a 32C. Viewers can clearly see them sitting under her sheer, cropped sweater, looking perfectly healed weeks after she initially announced her surgery. Around the same time as her augmentation, Doja also had liposuction and joked about having her "cl*t bedazzled" in a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">comedic tweet</a>. The "Woman" songstress was candid (<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">and sometimes silly</a>) while answering questions about the procedures, and now, she's proudly showing off her new body for the world on her Story.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-doja-cat-is-in-ha-mood-ahead-of-hellmouth>Doja Cat is In Ha Mood Ahead of Hellmouth</h2></span><p>@dojacat/Instagram Story</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier in the week, she shared some <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">similar photos</a>, which saw her rocking MSCHF's Big Red Boots along with her see-through sweater. On Friday (April 21), Doja returned with more, this time switching up her look to add yellow-tinted sunglasses sitting on her smokily-beaten face. While one photo certainly would've been enough to satisfy most, the blonde beauty blessed IG with two more. The second shows her cooly exhaling smoke while flaunting her abs for the camera.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">To end the show, Doja Cat gave us another view of her outfit, this one from the side, further proving how perky her chest is thanks to her operation. As we continue the countdown to Hellmouth, the Californian surprised music lovers last weekend by hopping on the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">remix of SZA's "Kill Bill,"</a> which she <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">obviously killed</a>. The artist's second collaboration comes after DC promised to bring better-than-ever-before rap bars on her upcoming album. Read more about that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">here</a>, and check back later for more pop culture news updates.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">More Snapshots</h2></span><p>@dojacat/Instagram Story</p><p>@dojacat/Instagram Story</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Hayley Hynes is the former Weekend Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop, she stepped down after two years in 2024 to pursue other creative opportunities but remains on staff part-time to cover music, gossip, and pop culture news.
