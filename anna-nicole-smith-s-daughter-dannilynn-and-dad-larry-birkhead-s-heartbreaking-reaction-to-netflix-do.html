You are and have been doing an excellent job raising your child." A third added: "I feel terrible for your daughter. I wish her happiness and closure."

With access to never-before-seen footage, home movies, and interviews with key figures who have not spoken out until now, [the title] reveals new insights into the story of the quintessential blonde bombshell hardly anyone really knew."</p><p id=ef5GhFDq6E data-wc=23>In February 2007, Anna Nicole was found unresponsive in a Florida hotel room and was pronounced dead in hospital.
