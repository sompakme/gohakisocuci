And you'll have to kiss a lot of proverbial frogs (or sniff some unpleasant scents) to get your Cinderella moment. But choosing your go-to perfume doesn't have to be a royal hassle, as there are easy ways (more on that at the end) to pinpoint the one that is the right fit for your needs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To help you start your scent journey on a high note, we reviewed the best perfumes for women to create this list of 15 for floral fanatics, spice sensationalists, celebrity fragrance collectors, and more. Here's a hint: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chanel Coco Mademoiselle Eau de Parfum</a> takes the top spot for best overall thanks to its universal appeal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Without further adieu, here are the best perfumes for women that are floral, spicy, fruity, sexy, and undeniably timeless.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-chanel-coco-mademoiselle-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chanel Coco MadeMoiselle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chanel Coco MadeMoiselle Eau de Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RkhwwtQcuEQROrP2OWrJ_Jm2X3k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chanel-coco-mademoiselle-eau-de-parfum-spray-4db51dec52e8432383e6b9c695147941.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>It is a classic, youthful blend of orange, patchouli, and Turkish rose.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Timeless, yet still youthful, you really can't go wrong with this Chanel scent and it's easy to see why. Unlike its superstar big sister Chanel N°5, Mademoiselle is suitable for everyday wear thanks to an alluring blend of orange, patchouli, and Turkish rose. While it does start off strong and pungent with a deep, musky floral aroma, we love that it eventually unfolds to a subtle, warm patchouli over time. Just an FYI, like other perfumes on our list, just a little bit of this fragrance goes a long way; spritz lightly on your wrists and neck, and let it work its magic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 1.2 oz.｜<strong>Type</strong>: Eau de Parfum｜<strong>Notes:</strong> Orange, Patchouli, and Turkish Rose</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Joy Kim</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-sol-de-janeiro-brazilian-crush-cheirosa-62-bum-bum-hair--body-fragrance-mist></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Crush Cheirosa</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Crush Cheirosa 62 Bum Bum Hair &amp;amp; Body Fragrance Mist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DglAt0vowjkuAfSgCalfF1xvNfw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sephora-sol-de-janeiro-brazilian-crush-cheirosa-62-bum-bum-hair--body-fragrance-mist-b0890b838ac3490ba1efd4ab5dfd5644.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to an energizing blend of pistachio, jasmine petals, vanilla, and sandalwood, this sunny fragrance is like a summer vacation in a bottle, sans the sunblock. We love that it's affordable and can be used on the hair, body, and even clothing whenever you need a refreshening boost. Overall, it's flirty and beachy without being too overpowering, making it a great pick for those who love sweet summer scents in a less potent formula than a eau de parfum.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 3.04 oz.｜<strong>Type</strong>: Fragrance Mist｜<strong>Notes:</strong> Pistachio, Jasmine Petals, Vanilla, Sandalwood</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-luxury-tom-ford-lost-cherry-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Luxury</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tom Ford Parfum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tom Ford Lost Cherry" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4h8OU6sdg1cfevanIZ_rbu1lUuU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tom-ford-lost-cherry-938e17706c26445baf193a3f289c87b4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tom Ford</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Strong, musky, and oh-so mysterious, this fragrance is worth the splurge if you're looking for a scent for all the special occasions on your calendar. After all, its blend of black cherry, tonka bean, and almond notes give it a liqueur-like aroma that isn't too sweet or off-putting. Plus, if you're after vanity candy, this bottle is surely going be the main attraction on your perfume tray.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 oz.｜<strong>Type</strong>: Eau de Parfum｜<strong>Notes:</strong> Black Cherry, Tonka Bean, Almond</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Joy Kim</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-floral-carolina-herrera-good-girl-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Floral</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Carolina Herrera Good Girl Eau de Parfum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Carolina Herrera Good Girl Eau de Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/o6wl14cFwof71zzx6lg8NqQCogY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/carolina-herrera-good-girl-eau-de-parfum-d0e24ba217004b73afa1ddc62286eddf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This floral perfume is a powerhouse and anything but meek. The seductive mix of tuberose, jasmine, and tonka bean is floral, but not in a little girl way. Name aside, this scent is all woman and sexy with a capital S. "This is one of those floral fragrances that makes a statement," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Shannon M. Bauer</a>, senior commerce beauty editor at InStyle. "It's sweet but has a dark, warm layer that keeps it sophisticated. It's my go-to date perfume and I always get compliments on it. Plus, I'm a sucker for a good bottle and the high heel shape is top-of-the-vanity worthy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 oz.｜<strong>Type</strong>: Eau de Parfum ｜<strong>Notes:</strong> Tuberose, Jasmine, Tonka Bean</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-woody-maison-margiela-replica-by-the-fireplace></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Woody</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maison Margiela Replica</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Maison Margiela Replica By the Fireplace" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gjxb-ZeX_njRd6BJFEO6dchBTww=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/maison-margiela-replica-by-the-fireplace-ef26dd1374d0402880af418a4b6c9446.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If unique and woody scents are what you're after, then this fragrance is worth adding to your wishlist. Think of chestnuts roasting on an open fire? It's not surprising, after all, it is reminiscent of just that thanks to clove oil, chestnut and vanilla accord notes. While it starts off strong with spicy top notes, it eventually dries down to its sweet vanilla base, making it intriguing from start to finish. Bonus: the unisex scent is appreciated by all genders.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 1 oz.｜<strong>Type</strong>: Eau de Toilette｜<strong>Notes:</strong> Clove Oil, Chestnut Accord, and Vanilla Accord</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-citrus-potion-perfume-super-sun></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Citrus</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Potion Perfume Super Sun</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Potion Perfume Super Sun" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ptBO-gVDv-7FhHOOrSgBwUFStl0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/potion-perfume-super-sun-b861835e00b34909a9325341efa7a4f1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spitfiregirl</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A fragrance that's recommended by an expert nose is a surefire bet. "This daytime fragrance screams summer with hints of dusty citrus and spice," says Kristin Scott, master perfumer and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">ATUM Fragrance</a>. "Any wearer is sure to radiate power and confidence no matter what their day has in store for them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 1 oz.｜<strong>Type</strong>: Fragrance Mist｜<strong>Notes:</strong> Sicilian Orange, Cardamom, Saffron, Madagascar Nutmeg, Turmeric, and Indonesian Patchouli</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fruity-ellis-brooklyn-sun-fruit-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fruity</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ellis Brooklyn SUN FRUIT Eau de Parfum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ellis Brooklyn SUN FRUIT Eau de Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/T8ZfttmgSHo1poykiVoOkAVDwV4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ellis-brooklyn-sun-fruit-eau-de-parfum-6da165a038e245deb5f58ec82d2f0297.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you hear fruit, you might associate it with sweet. But that's not always the case. This scent cleverly utilizes fresh fig instead of traditional fruit notes to create its unique blend. And when combined with jasmine and vanilla planifolia, the overall result is a beautiful summer-ready aroma that is light, flirty, and warm — kinda like your favorite sun dress. FYI: this fragrance also meets Sephora's Clean and Planet Positive standards, so it's another must-have for clean beauty enthusiasts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 oz.｜<strong>Type</strong>: Eau de Parfum ｜<strong>Notes: </strong>Fresh Fig, Handpicked Jasmine, Vanilla Planifolia</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Joy Kim</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-musky-juliette-has-a-gun-not-a-perfume></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Musky</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Juliette Has a Gun Not A Perfume</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Juliette Has a Gun Not A Perfume" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YWRXd3pJtw_1NW7O3dx_EUdoL48=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/juliette-has-a-gun-not-a-perfume-863c425287324dc5aa8b5396b5bf6f0d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this scent isn't as complex as other fragrances, its singular note still packs a punch. Cetalox, the single note, is typically used in perfumery as a base note to create a musky amber layer. Due to its simplicity, it's a great choice for minimalists who want a fuss-free scent, or for those who like to layer scents together to create a unique fragrance blend. Even better is that it's also hypoallergenic, so it's a must try for sensitive wearers, too. The single note makes this a polarizing perfume — you'll either love or hate it — but it's definitely worth a sniff.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 3.3 oz.｜<strong>Type</strong>: Eau de Parfum ｜<strong>Notes: </strong>Cetalox (Synthetic Ambergris)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fresh-clean-classic-warm-cotton-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fresh</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Clean Classic Warm Cotton</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Classic Warm Cotton Eau de Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/a6l3DVtqxnZ71H_1FM7H6feEIHo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/clean-reserve-classic---warm-cotton-469ffc84019b4ec5901b335e0a51c793.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Need a quick burst of clean during the workday? You're in luck — this bergamot, peony, and amber-filled scent is a great pick-me-up worth adding to your bag, as it's light, airy, and boasts staying power. It has that freshly laundered sheets on a spring day with the windows open kinda vibe, but in the best way possible as it's neither too musky nor overpowering.

Then it melts into a sophisticated vanilla and white flower layer. It's easy to liken it to the LBD tucked in your closet — it's sleek, iconic, and too intriguing to resist. However, sexiness is not this fragrance's only strong suit. The warm gourmand and spicy combo is well-balanced enough to make a memorable impression without being cloying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 1.9 oz.｜<strong>Type</strong>: Eau de Parfum｜<strong>Notes: </strong>Coffee, White Flowers, and Vanilla</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-daytime-by-rosie-jane-dylan-perfume></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Daytime</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>By Rosie Jane Dylan Perfume</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="By Rosie Jane Dylan Perfume" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6UnKyAN6k8g6bnuLxnkLOC8-tiA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/by-rosie-jane-dylan-perfume-24191bd1bbd54cf7b80ac5310ffc71df.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There's no denying this earthy scent is a daytime delight, as it's crisp, clean, and inviting. That being said, whether you wear it to work or Sunday brunch with the family, rest assured it won't be too overpowering or headache-inducing. We love the fragrance's combination of frankincense and sweet musks, making it equal parts earthy and warm. Even better is that it's unisex, so don't be surprised if your S.O. ends up borrowing it from time to time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 oz.｜<strong>Type</strong>: Eau de Parfum ｜<strong>Notes: </strong>Cedar, Frankincense, and Musk</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-perfume-oil-palermo-vitality-aromatherapy-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Perfume Oil</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>PALERMO Vitality Aromatherapy Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="PALERMO Vitality Aromatherapy Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gVgK9asLYD09_rxVjYryqBZzKO0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/palermo-vitality-aromatherapy-oil-1fa9499d87124ff696e0876895c8e7e1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rollerballs are a great choice when you want to target your perfume application and an oil takes that concept to the next level. "This blend is like spring in a bottle, with all the lusty, blossoming excitement the season brings," says InStyle deputy editor Lauren Norkin. "The sandalwood and jasmine is floral in a bursting-from-the-ground way. It's made with essential oils and a fractionated coconut oil base which helps it cling to the skin and stick with you all day, rather than wafting around you in a cloud. The brand promises a burst of confidence and a sense of romance, and I have to say I'd agree."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: .33 oz.｜<strong>Type</strong>: Oil｜<strong>Notes: </strong>Jasmine, Sandalwood, and Cardamom Oils</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-clean-the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Clean</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The 7 Virtues Vanilla Woods</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The 7 Virtues Vanilla Woods Eau de Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9DPr6-0IObPeQE5GVtRL02Wgm_E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-216d4f3297ee42358b8101a2c5437daf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>It's free of phthalates, parabens, sulfates, and synthetic dyes.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As it's free of phthalates, parabens, sulfates, and synthetic dyes, this is one clean scent to nab if you're looking for perfumes that cut down on the filler ingredients. However, being 'clean' doesn't mean this fragrance is weak or that it fades quickly — it packs a powerful punch of fresh pear, rose, and sustainably-sourced vanilla. Overall, it's warm and romantic, and its vanilla note is not overly sweet (like that suspect candle you were gifted last Christmas).

It's the new Sketchers collaboration of the early aughts. While Britney Spears, Billie Eilish, and Dolly Parton have scents we love, we had to name Ariana Grande as the winner for the celeb category. Why? This scent is suitable for everyday-wear and a wide range of scent preferences thanks to a blend of clean, sweet, and sultry notes. The top is bright and fresh with lavender, pear, and bergamot, then it fades to a coconut, praline, and musk finish.

That being said, to determine which bottle size is best for you, she said to ask yourself if you want a beautiful big bottle on your dresser or something that is more portable. That way, you know exactly what you need before you shop.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The type of fragrance you choose is based on personal preference, Johnston says.

However, you can apply more of this type of scent before becoming overwhelming. A pro for heavy spritzers. An eau de parfum is the most potent with the highest concentration of fragrance oil and an eau de toilette sits right in the middle. An eau de toilette typically has four to six hours of wear time, whereas parfum has eight to 10. But good to know: the concentration changes the intensity and duration, but shouldn't change the way your favorite scent smells.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Notes</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Top notes are also known as head notes, they are what pull you into the perfume, Johnston tells InStyle. Top notes are also the first notes to fade. "However, keep in mind that the top note is not always representative of the way your perfume will end up smelling," she adds. "It normally takes about ten minutes for a perfume to reveal most of its notes." The middle, or heart, and base notes are what combine to form the main theme of a perfume. These notes are often more rounded, less flashy, and linger long after the top notes have faded.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Selecting a perfume you like can take a lot of trial and error to learn the language and the notes that work for you.

"Top notes are the first notes you smell when you apply perfume," she tells InStyle. "A simple way to break it down is by asking yourself if you typically prefer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>floral perfumes</a>, or citrus, woody, or clean notes. Then, try fragrances that feature those notes as top notes." Amorphous then advises considering the base notes, as she explains that "they are the notes that will linger the longest on your skin after the top and middle notes have dissipated slightly. Base notes are typically woods, leathers, vanillas, ambers, and musks." By narrowing down your preferred top and base notes beforehand, Amorphous says it ultimately can speed up the fragrance selection process. "If you dislike florals and woods, you can skip right over those fragrances and move onto clean or citrus perfumes," she adds. And remember: the process should be fun! Finding your signature scent can be a journey, but finding that perfume that fits is a huge confidence booster.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you apply perfume?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Always apply perfume to the pulse points first (the wrists, neck, inside of the elbows, and back the knees), because these are the warmest areas of the body," says Amorphous. "This allows the fragrance to amplify and diffuse more thoroughly. However, when applying stronger and heavier perfumes, she suggests spraying the perfume a short distance in front of you, and then walking into the mist rather than spraying it directly. "This prevents the fragrance from going on too strong." If you have a lighter fragrance or one that seems to disappear quickly, spread a dab of Vaseline on your pulse points before applying it to add longevity to the scent. Perfume doesn't stick as well to dry skin, so the ointment holds the fragrance to your skin for longer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2Bmv9Nmp56qlqq6pr%2BMn6arZaekuqa6</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leagues-cup-2023-carlos-salcedo-calls-for-the-use-of-var-in-the-leagues-cup-after-foul-on-messi-in.html><span>←</span><span>Leagues Cup 2023: Carlos Salcedo calls for the use of VAR in the Leagues Cup after foul on Messi in</span></a>
