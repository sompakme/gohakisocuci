In fact, Flair admits he screwed up by wrestling after his legendary WrestleMania 24 with Shawn Michaels.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ric Flair finally got the chance to retire on his own&nbsp;</a>terms earlier last year. The Nature Boy teamed up with his son-in-law Andrade El Idolo and faced Jay Lethal and Jeff Jarrett on July 31st, 2022.</p><p>Ric Flair took some scary bumps and even bled during the match,&nbsp;<a href=#>something that he promised to do&nbsp;</a>prior to the event.&nbsp;<a href=#>He also faked heart attack</a>, which worried many people. While Flair won the match, it was evident that many fans did not want him to even compete in the first place.</p><p>While speaking on his <a href=#>To Be The Man</a> podcast, Ric Flair discussed which fellow WWE Hall of Famers he believes did not have a proper retirement match and named the likes of Triple H and more. That being said, The Nature realizes how incredibly lucky he is.</p><p>“Hunter, I was saying that two years ago when he cut way back on his, on his wrestling,” Flair said. “Now he can’t have it … There are a couple of guys who never really had a retirement match. Dusty didn’t, Piper didn’t. Hell, there’s more people that didn’t get one than there are that did.</p><p>Despite his last match that took place in 2020, Flair still considers his WrestleMania 24 match against Shawn Michaels as his proper retirement match and admits he screwed up by wrestling after that.</p><p>“I’m probably the luckiest son of a bitch alive. I think mine will stand the rest of time with Shawn, I just shouldn’t haven’t screwed it up with going back to work.”</p><p>Ric Flair is also very happy with how the match turned out but has since made numerous teases about having yet another match in the future. We’ll have to see what’s next in store for Ric Flair.</p><p>What’s your take on the final match? Do you Ric with Charlotte Flair?
