The palace spokesperson also commented on the fact that the pair's children will not be attending, saying: <strong>"Prince Joachim will be there, but the children go to school, there is no special reason,"&nbsp;</strong>before confirming that Joachim will leave the country the following day.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2f0e8aed3aaf-princess-marie-prince-joachim-athena-felix-henrik-and-nikolai.jpg><p id=ezaQRtF8rh data-wc=74>The family have appeared to show signs of tension since <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Margrethe decided to strip Joachim's children of their HRH titles</a> in late 2022, instead making them counts and countess of Monpezat – a change which took effect from the start of last year. The change affected Joachim and Marie's two children, 14-year-old Henrik, and 11-year-old Athena, as well as the sons the prince shares with his ex-wife Alexandra: Nikolai, 24 and Felix, 21.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a156163abb38-gettyimages-1240349774.jpg><p id=e9t5e5m7VI data-wc=64>Speaking at the time, Joachim made an unprecedented public statement about his mother's decision, saying: <strong>"We are all very sad. It's never fun to see your children being mistreated like that. They themselves find themselves in a situation they do not understand."</strong> The queen went on to <a class=hm-link href=#>apologise for the shake-up</a>, which still sees her grandchildren retain their places in the line of succession.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/689beaf90b6b-danish-royals-balcony.jpg><p id=eqhJqwRWOq data-wc=72>In a heartfelt statement shared to her official social media accounts, she said: "It is my duty and desire as Queen to ensure that the Monarchy is forever forming in pact with time. It sometimes requires making difficult decisions, and finding the right time will always be difficult. To wear a royal title entails a number of obligations and tasks, which will in the future restrain fewer members of the royal family."&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The Danish royal family's most talked about moments: title rows, Prince Frederik's trip to Spain and more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/19cfe15d228f-gettyimages-1251877362.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The Danish royal family's most talked about moments: title rows, Prince Frederik's trip to Spain and more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The Danish royal family's most talked about moments: title rows, Prince Frederik's trip to Spain and more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="What Prince Joachim was doing when his mother Queen Margrethe delivered abdication news" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/2a882bb7193b-prince-joachim-with-prince-frederik-queen-margrethe.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="What Prince Joachim was doing when his mother Queen Margrethe delivered abdication news" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>What Prince Joachim was doing when his mother Queen Margrethe delivered abdication news</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Prince Joachim and Princess Marie share rare glimpse inside Washington home" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/09381cdc6331-prince-joachim-princess-marie.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Prince Joachim and Princess Marie share rare glimpse inside Washington home" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Prince Joachim and Princess Marie share rare glimpse inside Washington home</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e2gnUUSt9mA data-wc=23>Sunday's event will see the Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, proclaim the new monarch King Frederik X from the balcony of Christianborg Palace.&nbsp;</p><span class=socialEmbedCaptionClass_s1blps23>Danish royals are always proclaimed from Christiansborg Castle</span><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eNDKAtWZTG data-wc=68>It comes after Queen Margrethe made a speech and posted a statement to the official royal family website on 31 December, in which she announced: "I have decided that now is the right time.
