He’s become one of the biggest brands in America with collaborations alongside McDonald’s, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Jordan</a>, and Fortnite to show for it.

He hasn’t dropped much music since then, so it’s still unclear what we should expect from him o Utopia. Though he previously hinted at a project titled, Dystopia, the predecessor to Utopia, it appears that those plans may have been trashed and he’s gearing up to directly unleash his his fourth studio album.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-epic-records-ceo-shares-update-on-travis-scott-s-utopia-release-date>Epic Records CEO Shares Update On Travis Scott’s “Utopia” Release Date</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Travis Scott's boss quietly revealed when we should expect the project last month. In a resurfaced excerpt from Sylvia Rhone’s cover story for Billboard’s Women In Music 2023’s Executive Of The Year, she outlined what to expect from the label, including a timeframe for Scott’s forthcoming effort. “We have a new Travis Scott record, expected to come in June,” Rhone’s said before giving a shout out to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a>. “Last year, Future delivered the biggest album of his 10-year career at the company. How many hip-hop artists can do that and still be relevant?”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The resurfaced excerpt comes shortly after Travis Scott announced that his upcoming album would arrive after the rest of the Cactus Jack roster releases their respective projects. It seems that the campaign began this morning when <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Don Toliver</a> released Love Sick. “We got Faygo about to put a little EP out. That’s on the way. And right after that, Utopia,” he said during a concert. So, it seems like Utopia will be coming out just in time for the summer, if all goes to plan. Just before that, he informed fans that Utopia was<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> coming soon</a> during a celebrity softball game.
