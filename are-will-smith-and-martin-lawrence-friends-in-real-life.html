"[We have a] great deal of respect and love for each other," Lawrence told <a href=#>Vibe</a> while discussing his co-star in 2020. After knowing each other for years, the two had developed an unspoken bond. "We just understand each other. We know how to support each other," Smith said. "When you just understand each other it's like such a deep gift to not have to explain what you need," the "Wild Wild West" star added while saying he could tell that Lawrence was fatigued.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Even though the two actors had not worked together since 2003 for "Bad Boys II," it had not impacted their friendship. "I just love Will, and we always stayed in touch over the years as good friends," the "Martin" star told the <a href=#>Las Vegas Review-Journal</a> in 2020. That made filming together that much more special. "I'd look across the room and there was my friend. It felt good," Lawrence added, as he mentioned how he and Smith would crack jokes with each other "between takes."</p><p dir=ltr>That chemistry between the pair was apparent even before they worked together. Lawrence recalled his first time meeting Smith. "We talked for a little bit and it just felt natural. We made each other laugh," he told the LV Review Journal. In fact, it was Lawrence who handpicked Smith to be in the first "Bad Boys."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhja4Z2gY6aqZ5lp565rXnSpqCtoF2Wu6V5zJqpraGeYrmiw9GepZydXZu%2FqrHNnapmoZ5iv6aty2ajop6VZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./agbo-jedi-jedi-ingredients-and-recipes-how-to-prepare-it.html><span>←</span><span>Agbo Jedi Jedi ingredients and recipes: How to prepare it</span></a>
