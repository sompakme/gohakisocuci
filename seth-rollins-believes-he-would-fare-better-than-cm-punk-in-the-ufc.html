That is why his stint in the world of combat sports is always a joke for many.</p><p>While speaking to <a href=#>Merc Raimondi of ESPN</a>, Seth Rollins was asked if he would call out anyone in the UFC, expressing that while he would likely lose, he believes he could perform better than CM Punk did in the Octagon.</p><p>I’d call them all out,” he said. “I don’t care. I can’t do what they do. I’d probably get knocked out and choked in two seconds. Still, I might do better than Punk [CM Punk], but I would likely lose. They can’t come and do what we do either. Same umbrella, but two totally different worlds.”</p><p>Even Ernest ‘The Cat’ Miller previously claimed that <a href=#>even 12-year-old kids could knock out CM Punk</a>. CM Punk retired from MMA in 2018 after losing his second fight and has not competed in the Octagon since. His MMA record stands as a permanent mark on his career and is unlikely to be altered.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What do you think of what Seth Rollins had to say?
