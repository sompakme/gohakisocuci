The TLC icon shared her story on Instagram, and it all began when her 22-year-old daughter Chase left a doctor's appointment. T-Boz, real name Tionne Watkins, shares Chase with rapper Mack 10. According to Watkins, Chase noticed something "weird" on her windshield. She was aware of sex trafficking tactics, so she didn't touch the item and instead jumped in her car and drove to a public, safe location.</p><p>“You’ll always hear about sex trafficking and stuff like that. So, my daughter was just leaving the doctor’s office, and when she came to the car, she had a weird thing on her windshield wiper," explained T-Boz. "So, instead of touching it, ’cause when you do they’ll have some kind of drug substance on there that’ll make you drowsy and knock you out." Quick thinking may have saved Chase's life.</p><span><h2 id=h-t-boz-issues-a-warning>T-Boz Issues a Warning</h2></span><p>She continued: “So this is the thing. She looked at her surroundings, she hurried up and got in the car, drove off. Went to a safe, crowded location, and took some object to knock it off. But now, the concern is now I hear they put trackers on your car. So if you have a father, brother, male around, police station, wherever, make sure y’all check for trackers so they won’t track you guys home or to the next location.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Chase shared her mother's video on her Instagram Story and was surprised it went viral. She echoed T-Boz and cautioned the public to stay alert. The windshield trick is a speculated<a href=# rel> tactic with traffickers</a> that has spread like wildfire in recent years. It's stated they usually leave a note, a flower, or some strange item on a person's car. When someone stops to view or read, it gives a kidnapper or trafficker enough time to snatch the person away. Additionally, it's said that people leave markings on vehicles that look like strange lettering. It's the trafficker's way of noting if the potential victim, usually a woman, has children or a man with her. These markings have allegedly also been found outside of people's homes on mailboxes. However, the validity of these tactics is questionable.
