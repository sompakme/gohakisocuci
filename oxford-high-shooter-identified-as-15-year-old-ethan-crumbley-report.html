Authorities were able to detain Crumbley without further incident and CNN reports that the teen has been charged as an adult. He faces charges of terrorism causing death, four counts of first-degree murder, seven counts of assault with intent to murder, and 2 counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Crumbley has pleaded not guilty.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Among the wounded were a 14-year-old girl who was on a ventilator following surgery, Bouchard said Tuesday night. On Wednesday, it was announced she had been taken off the ventilator and was in stable condition. A 14-year-old boy had a<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> gunshot wound to the jaw</a> and head. The teacher, a 15-year-old boy and a 17-year-old boy were discharged, Bouchard said.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Investigators have stated that this incident was "absolutely premeditated." Photos of Crumbley that have circulated online show him much younger than his age, and the public has been steadily complaining that the media is attempting to make him<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> seem more innocent</a> than he is. Also, it has been stated that Crumbley's parents may face charges, themselves.
