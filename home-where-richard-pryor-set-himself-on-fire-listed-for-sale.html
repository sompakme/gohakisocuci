According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Mansion Global</a>, Mendenhall purchased the spread, located in the Sherwood Forest enclave of Northridge, for $2.5 million in 2017; he’s now set his sale price at <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hiltonhyland.com/property/17267-parthenia-st-sherwood-forest-ca-91325/>$4.236 million</a>, an homage to the total rushing yards he had in his career of 4,236.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I’m a fan of Richard Pryor,” Mendenhall told Mansion Global. “He’s iconic, and I feel a special connection to him because we’re both from Illinois — I’m from Skokie, and he’s from Peoria. He’s a man of such magnitude that when I saw the property, I thought, ‘What was good enough for him is good enough for me.’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Pryor bought the house in the mid-1970s and was freebasing cocaine when, as <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/movies/richard-pryors-1980-fire-suicide-attempt/>People magazine</a> has written, he began “pouring 151-proof rum on his shirt and setting it ablaze with a lighter.” The comedian suffered burns covering more than 50 percent of his body. Pryor would go on to later joke about the incident in his comedy routines.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Pryor sold the 2.2-acre estate in 1989 for $940,000. And the house in which Pryor lived was destroyed by 1994’s Northridge earthquake.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">It was replaced with the current two-story, four-bedroom hacienda-style main residence, which harks back to the property’s 1910 roots as a ranch and citrus orchard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSC_4760.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Listed with Hilton & Hyland/Forbes Global Properties’ <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hiltonhyland.com/associates/neil-mcdermott/>Neil McDermott</a> and Beate Kessler-McDermott, the estate includes 9,000 square feet of living space in total across six buildings with six bedrooms in total. There is a detached guest house, a pool house with a kitchen, a dance studio/gym (which the listing notes could be turned into a recording or production studio), a children’s playhouse, sauna, three-car garage and kennel.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A legal horse property, the estate also features outdoor amenities such as event parking for around 25 cars, a pool with spa and waterfall, a barbecue pavilion, tennis court, putting green, vegetable garden, citrus trees and a green lawn.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvRnpilZZWowaLAxGipopuYlr%2Blec%2BrsKiqXZu8s7nEq2Seq6SWwaZ5xaipZquRobJuvsCsn5qqlGK6prrDnqWhmZyhenJ%2Bkm5vbW9kaH9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gabriel-hogan-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Gabriel Hogan Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
