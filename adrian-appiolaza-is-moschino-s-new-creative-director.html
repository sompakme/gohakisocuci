Prior to that, he was in the same role under Clare Waight Keller at Chloé. Earlier in his career, Appiolaza worked for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/a45873283/phoebe-philo-collection/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Phoebe Philo" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Phoebe Philo</a> at Chloé (she recruited him after seeing his graduate collection at Central Saint Martins), for Miu Miu, and for Marc Jacobs during the designer’s tenure at Louis Vuitton.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We are happy and honored to welcome Adrian to the Aeffe family,” Ferretti said in a statement. “I was immediately struck by the explosive creativity of Adrian, a personality full of energy and enthusiasm, elements that have always distinguished the history of the Moschino brand.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The news of Appiolaza appointment comes after the sudden death of Davide Renne, whom Moschino hired to replace Jeremy Scott last year. Despite the tragic circumstances surrounding the changes, the artistically minded Appiolaza will no doubt lead Moschino into a successful and bright—literally and figuratively—future. “I am ready to transport Moschino into a new chapter,” he said in this morning’s announcement, adding that he aims to do so “with a theatrical touch, in the pure style of Moschino.”</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Brooke Bobb is the fashion news director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.
