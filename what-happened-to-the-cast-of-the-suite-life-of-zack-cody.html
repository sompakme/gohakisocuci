Tipton. After the finale of "The Suite Life on Deck,"&nbsp;he continued to appear in numerous TV series&nbsp;and even reprised Moseby for a 2015 episode of the Disney Channel series "Jessie." Lewis has appeared in some Nickelodeon series, including "Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn," and "The Really Loud House."&nbsp;His voice can be heard in several episodes of the animated comedy "American Dad!"&nbsp;or seen on the big screen for "Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2."</p><p>However, Lewis has been focusing his efforts behind the camera, racking up more than 60 credits as a television director. Among the many series he's directed include "iCarly,"&nbsp;"Call Me Kat," "How I&nbsp;Met Your Father,"&nbsp;"One Day at a Time," and many more. In fact, it was while directing an episode of "Young and Hungry" that he reunited with former "Suite&nbsp;Life"&nbsp;co-star Ashley Tisdale, who was one of the show's producers.&nbsp;</p><p>In the years since "Suite Life"&nbsp;ended, Lewis has kept in touch with the cast and is particularly close to Brenda Song. "We had such a great relationship on the show, and she is like my other daughter,"&nbsp;Lewis said in a chat with <a href=#>OnTheSpotInterviews</a>. "So, we try to have lunch every couple of weeks, and just sit down, or text and email, and just keep each other apprised of what's going on."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtoZ4N1gY6wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZZOWwLV50q6grZ1dobansYyonWaykZi4bq3NnWScp5SufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sunset-celebration-in-key-west-gallery-of-artisans.html><span>←</span><span>Sunset Celebration in Key West- Gallery of Artisans</span></a>
