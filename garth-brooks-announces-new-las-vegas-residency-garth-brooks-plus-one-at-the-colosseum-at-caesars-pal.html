The tour ended in September when Garth played the fifth sold-out concert at Dublin, Ireland’s Croke Park. The five concerts were seen by over 400-thousand people.&nbsp;Also in September, Garth was honored with the Kris Kristofferson Lifetime Achievement Award at the NSAI’s Nashville Songwriter Awards, held at the Ryman Auditorium.&nbsp;</p><p>On sale now is “The Anthology, Part II: The Next Five Years.” In this Anthology, Garth picks up where he left off in “The Anthology, Part I: The First Five Years,” telling his story in his own words and offering fascinating insights to his career and personal life from 1996-2001.</p><p>In May 2021, Garth Brooks was one of five artists to receive one of the most prestigious honors an artist can receive, The Kennedy Center Honor. Garth is the first-ever seven-time recipient of the CMA Entertainer of the Year honor. Brooks is the first and only artist in history to receive nine Diamond Awards for the now nine diamond-certified albums at over 10 million album sales each. He remains the #1-selling solo artist in U.S. history, certified by the RIAA with 157 million album sales. Last year, he was awarded Country Touring Artist of the Decade at the 2021 Pollstar Awards. In March 2020, Garth received the esteemed Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. The event aired on PBS. He has received every accolade the recording industry can bestow on an artist.</p><p>In November 2020, just after receiving the Billboard Music Icon Award, Garth released two new albums, his 12th studio album, “FUN” and live album “Triple Live Deluxe.”&nbsp;</p><p>After the success of “Garth & Trisha Live!” during prime time on CBS in April 2020, CBS also aired “Garth & Trisha Live! A Holiday Concert Event,” in December. Both specials featured Garth and Trisha taking song requests through Facebook, live from their studio, Allentown, in Nashville.</p><p>In November of 2019, A&E aired “Garth Brooks: The Road I’m On,” over two consecutive nights. Part of their esteemed ‘Biography’ franchise, the documentary offered an intimate look at Garth’s life as a musician and father over his entire career.</p><p>In January 2020, Billboard announced that Garth Brooks was the first artist to make it on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in the 80s, 90s, 00s, 10s and now 20s. Garth debuted “Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)” in 1989. Now, with “Dive Bar,” a duet he sang with Blake Shelton, he makes his appearance on the list in 2020. The single inspired a DIVE BAR tour to dive bars in country music capitals around the country which will continue its run of stops through 2022.</p><p>Last year, Garth went vinyl with his meticulously-curated vinyl package, LEGACY. This career-defining collection includes No Fences, The Chase, In Pieces, Fresh Horses and Triple Live, plus CDs with bonus tracks for a total of 7 vinyl albums and 7 CDs in each edition.</p><p>In 2017, Garth finished the three-and-a-half-year long Garth Brooks World Tour with Trisha Yearwood.
