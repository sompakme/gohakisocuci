(WTO).</p><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>US</a>, Japan and the EU -- which attends G7 summits as an unofficial eighth partner -- have all voiced concern over China's so-called "industrial

pressed for a united G7 front.</p><p class=align-left>The leaders also called on China to stop restricting its exports of critical minerals used in key global industries such as telecommunications and
