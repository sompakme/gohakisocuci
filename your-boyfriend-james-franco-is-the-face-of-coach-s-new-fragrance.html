Let us count the ways. We love the fact that he had a Bar Mitzvah at the age of 37 to raise funds for the Alzheimer’s Association, and temporarily got an image of Elizabeth Taylor tattoed to his scalp. His friendship with Seth Rogen surpasses the title of a mere bromance, and we miss the days his sheet mask-adorned selfies would populate our Instagram feeds. We love him almost as much as he loves McDonald's—he even penned a heartfelt letter to the fast food chain in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Washington Post</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, your quirky boyfriend is taking his skills to Coach, where he'll be the face of their upcoming men's fragrance, Coach for Men. Of course, it isn't his first time fronting a scent. Back in 2013, Franco was the face of Gucci's Made to Measure scent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: How to Make Your Fragrance Last Longer</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Creativity is the way I engage with life. It's the way I engage with other people and communicate, and it's really the way I find meaning in life," Franco tells <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>WWD</a> in a very James Franco statement. "I enjoyed collaborating with Stuart [Vevers]. There are a lot of references to Coach tradition in his designs, but with an added spin, and that idea is something I have done in my creative work." We'll say.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Coach has had quite the makeover since Stuart Vevers took over as the brand's creative director, so it goes without saying that the very essence of James Franco aligns with their new direction. Coach for Men is set to launch this fall, so expect more news on that and Franco's ad campaign as more info is announced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGealrqmv4yfqZqmk6R6pLvAnJ9mnqKWtLOtzZyc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happens-if-you-blink-during-lasik-surgery.html><span>←</span><span>What happens if you blink during LASIK surgery?</span></a>
