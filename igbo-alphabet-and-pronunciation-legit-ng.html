Still, writing and teaching are provided on Latin letters basis.</p><p class=align-left>Vocalism of the Igbo language includes eight vowel phonemes, which form 2 series regarding the degree of ascent: high and low. Within this opposition, a harmony of vowels is realized, analogous to the synchronism in some other languages of the group.</p><p class=align-left>There are phonological contrasts of tones with both grammatical and lexical meanings. Igbo has a typical as many other languages in West Africa, the phenomenon of step-down sounds in the Syntagma. Personal pronouns in singular, form 2 series: independent pronouns and subjective brindle pronominal indicators (in plural the latter are absent). In case of the use of pronominal symbols, the vowel prefix of the verb stem is omitted (preserved with pronouns plural).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/33d012fee3adca0f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Pride Magazine Nigeria interrogates the digital in COVID times</span></p></a><h2>Igbo language history</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/33d012fee3adca0f.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Origin of Igbo tribe in Nigeria</p><p class=align-left>The first printed source in which individual words and expressions were officially published in the Igbo language was the book History of the Mission of the Evangelical Brothers in the Caribbean. It was in 1777.</p><p class=align-left>Later in London, a story about Olaudah Equiano was published. This time about 80 words on Igbo was used. Over time, the missionaries and writers who came to Nigeria increasingly often faced the use of various dialects of Igbo. Gradually, the language was spread almost throughout eastern Nigeria.</p><p class=align-left>In 1972, the SPILC introduced specific standards for the Igbo language and applied significant conditions for the language to become more prolific in other parts of the continent.</p><h2>Igbo grammatical relations</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5p11i5h1na9.jpg><p class=align-left>Igbo language learning divides verbs into two tonal morphological classes: high and low. There are two conjugated verb forms ("times") - perfect and imperfect type, or italic and punctuation, and also three aspects. Independent and three dependent verbal forms are opposed. The latter is used for different kinds of subordinate clauses (differ in tonal characteristics). There is also a system of verbal suffixes serving to express various additional meanings, including temporary.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1749a88c5a7e2421.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigeria at 60: We have cracks that can break us up - Osinbajo makes powerful revelations</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt24ail8dpl4mg.jpg><p class=align-left>Names are also divided into morphological classes according to tonal schemes in different syntagmatic constructs, in particular in a genitive construction.</p><p class=align-left>Writing is done on a Latin basis.
