World of Warcraft fans, noticing the trend of AI-driven websites scraping popular topics off social media, set a cunning trap. One player wrote a post about “Glorbo,” praising the upcoming feature."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Destiny 2 players are the latest players to exploit the power of Glorbo, and even Bungie is getting in on the act.</p><p id=L9kTp6>World of Warcraft fans, noticing the trend of AI-driven websites scraping popular topics off social media, set a cunning trap. <a href=#>One player wrote a post about “Glorbo,”</a> praising the upcoming feature. Of course, there is no such feature as a Glorbo; it was bait. Sure enough, an outlet called The Portal, published by ZLeague, wrote an article about how much fans love Glorbo, and a meme was born.</p><p id=threads_view_GQ80RKVNK-1690394420.379129-1690394678.225509>Destiny 2 fans noticed the Glorbo gambit, and took their own shot at staging a similar trap. In this context, Glorbo is not a new feature, but instead a mysterious secret boss.</p><p id=-post-rtjson-content>Fans were sure to maintain kayfabe across their posts. “Glorbo killed my grandma,”<a href=#> one poster shared mournfully</a>.</p><p id=NKPN8J>“I seriously can’t want for the Glorbo fight in season 23,” <a href=#>another post enthuses</a>. “There was a leak that Glorbo would be tougher than Oryx by the time he powers up in his veil acceptance chamber. I am seriously astonished by how well Bungie has slipped Glorbo into the most recent lore book on the Bungie Store and even the old grimoire pages of the Destiny 1 game.”</p><p id=9Ia7II>Of course, <a href=#>it worked this time too</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jmLYuyqOsNx2PjP-jrp2kMrvPz8=/0x0:1528x769/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:1528x769):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24812244/waybackmachine.png"><p id=Uq2wb7>I, for one, welcome our new Glorbo overlords. Glorbo’s successful transition from World of Warcraft to Destiny 2 suggests we may see bigger, bolder Glorbo moves. Perhaps a developer will even take the bold step of adding its very own glorbo to the mix.</p><p id=gynpge>This isn’t the first time fans have gone a little wild in making up their own lore. In the wait leading up to <a href=#>Elden Ring</a>, players who were desperate for more details started posting about playing through their own imaginary versions of the game, sharing lush fictional details about a FromSoftware game that does not exist. Glorbo was originally created as a trap, but it fits into the same mold of fans just having fun by being silly together. Tricking AI sites is just a bonus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbvLsp6opl6YvK57kWxvaXBpZ4JwsMSsq6KmqWJ%2FbrPLqKmbp12Wtm6%2FyK2crGWjmrCzsdNmmairo2K%2FtrrNoqWgZZqkuKY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-frank-rocky-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Frank Rocky?
