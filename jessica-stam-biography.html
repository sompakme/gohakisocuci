"He changed me," says the natural beauty, who shared an apartment and struggled to make ends meet in New York before being introduced to the famous snapper. "The only place I had to myself was a top bunk and my suitcase."<br></p><p id=ezBCYsaB55 data-wc=62>Jessica made her entry into the world on April 23, 1986, joining a large, devout Christian family on a farm in Kincardine, Ontario. Growing up in the countryside alongside six brothers, her biggest influence was her faith. During her childhood, she sang in the church choir, performed in plays for the congregation, and dreamed of becoming a dentist when she grew up.</p><h2>Jessica Stam's modelling career</h2><p id=eVf4ZGZgYx data-wc=66>It wasn't until after the stunner, then 16, was discovered by a model scout at a coffee shop that she found out what modelling was all about. Her parents encouraged her to grab hold of the exciting prospect with both hands. "They told me that this was my moment," says Jessica. "They believe this opportunity was given to me and I have to go with it."</p><p id=eUIkssC7OhzP data-wc=91>It proved a fortuitous decision for the budding model, who shortly afterwards won the Los Angeles Model Look Search. But it wasn't until she moved to New York that her persistence truly paid off. Renowned fashion photographer Steven Meisel was instrumental in ensuring Jessica's success. By casting the young beauty in numerous ad campaigns that required her to change the colour of her hair every week, he gave her a chameleon-like quality, similar to that associated with fellow Canadian Linda Evangelista. "He brings out the best in me," says Jessica modestly.</p><p id=eFziBiLfSDC1 data-wc=71>Following successful campaigns for Versace and Prada, the 5ft 10in model star found herself splashed across the pages of Italian, German and American <i>Vogue</i>. In 2004 she further extended her career with a venture into acting, appearing as Orange Girl in the short flick <i>Agent Orange</i>. And another hair change, from flaming auburn to platinum blonde, in the summer of 2005 placed the small-town girl firmly on the international fashion map.&nbsp;</p><p id=e9SSTHOWGzuD data-wc=80>That same summer she was cast for no less than 54 runway shows, including such big guns as Marc Jacobs, Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana and Armani. And Marc Jacobs was so inspired by the new model that in 2006 he created a bag named in her honour 'The Stam'. Jessica's profile received a further boost that December when she joined <a class=hm-link href=#>Victoria's Secret</a> as one of the luxury lingerie label's angels, taking to the catwalk alongside <a class=hm-link href=#>Gisele Bundchen</a> and Karolina Kurkova.</p><h2>Jessica Stam's personal life</h2><p id=eQcGZ-Wf3bXo data-wc=62>In the past Jessica has been romantically linked to singer Anthony Kiedis, lead vocalist with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Harrison Ford's son Malcolm. She announced in 2017 that <a class=hm-link href=#>she was expecting her first child</a> - a baby girl, and in July 2020 Jessica confirmed she was expecting her second child, but she hasn't revealed more details about her family life.</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9yZ5qawLS1wppkrKyRonw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jaime-fabregas-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Jaime Fabregas Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
