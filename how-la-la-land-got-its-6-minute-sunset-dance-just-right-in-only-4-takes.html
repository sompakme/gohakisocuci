To do that, we had to shoot on a crane. There were 27 different marks on the crane to hit, and the actors had to hit their marks as well.”</p><img decoding=async width=928 height=559 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lll_d33_05704-embed.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Filmed in Super <span data-scayt_word=35mm data-scaytid=5>35mm</span>, the ambitious shot is consistent with the overall color palette of the film — lots of pinks, blues, greens — and also was inspired by the Technicolor films of the ‘<span data-scayt_word=50s data-scaytid=6>50s</span> and ‘<span data-scayt_word=60s data-scaytid=7>60s</span>. “This scene was meant to be a very romantic moment after the party.
