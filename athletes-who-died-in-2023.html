He debuted with the NHL in 1957 when he joined the Chicago Blackhawks. He led the league in both goals and point-scoring for three seasons, and in 1961, he helped his team claim the Stanley Cup. Hull was the first NHL player to score over 50 goals in a single season, which is one of many accomplishments, including winning the coveted Gordie Howe Trophy twice.</p><p>In 1972, Hull signed as both a coach and a player with the Winnipeg Jets, a World Hockey Association team, for an unprecedented $1.75 million plus a $1 million bonus. Hull finished his playing career with the Hartford Whalers in 1980, which put him on the same team as Gordie Howe. After retirement, Hull's number nine jersey was retired and he became the figurehead commissioner of the WHA. Unfortunately, Hull's personal choices were reportedly&nbsp;a different story. Per <a href=#>The New York Times</a>, he assaulted a police officer and was arrested, allegedly assaulted two of his wives, and allegedly "[aired]&nbsp;repugnant views on race, genetics and Hitler."</p><p>On January 30, 2023, Hull died at 84. His son, Brett (also a Hall of Famer), shared on&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>&nbsp;via the St. Louis Blues: "It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of my dad, Bobby Hull. Throughout his 84 years, he gave my family — and everyone he met — a tremendous amount of great memories." Hull had an&nbsp;exceptionally fast slap shot, 610 NHL career goals, and was one of the greatest players in professional hockey. Hull's cause of death has not been made public.</p><p>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233.
