At the height of her career in the 1980s and 90s she was one of the world’s best-paid models, gracing the covers of and&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/10f923bce8d5-yasmin-le-bon-1.jpg><p id=eTj6EZId1i8E data-wc=31>By the time of the supermodel era that saw the rise of Linda Evangelista, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Christy Turlington</a>, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Cindy Crawford</a> and <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Naomi Campbell</a> she was already an established face in the fashion industry.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Yasmin Le Bon on life with husband Simon&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=eD5XjGPndu0 data-wc=43>Yasmin met now-husband Simon of the band Duran Duran in 1984 after he spotted her in a magazine and tracked her down via her modelling agency. “The very first date that I went on with my husband was at Langans Basserie in Mayfair.”</p><p id=eRPxWK1m3Ju data-wc=37>A year later they married in a low-key ceremony in the register office at Oxford’s Westgate shopping centre to avoid the paparazzi. Yasmin wore an outfit from Benetton which was the only store she could get to.&nbsp;</p><p id=egtI4DuucL_ data-wc=62>As parents to Amber, 34, Saffron, 32, and Tallulah, 29, their daughters are still frequent visitors to the couple’s double-fronted home in Putney, London, and Saffron lives with her partner and their two children, Taro and Skye, in a cottage next door. Simon, 65, once proudly called himself a “glamfather” and Yasmin has fondly described the family home as a “mad place”.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d5e38e664b71-yasmin-le-bon-2.jpg><h3><strong>Yasmin Le Bon on ageing&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=ey9HlQjDRQd data-wc=53>Reflecting on entering a new decade, she says: “I have no plans at all to celebrate my 60th. A cup of tea in bed would be nice, and maybe a trip to the Royal Academy of Arts. I’d really love to do something or learn something new. Maybe finally do a pottery class!&nbsp;</p><p id=eEtt5Rtz9PER data-wc=66>“I don’t think I care as much about what people think about me. I now realise that the world doesn’t revolve around me and I like that. I like being able to stand back and have some perspective on life. I also think I have become so much funnier. I obviously spend way too much time with my family, but honestly, I laugh all the time.&nbsp;</p><p id=eQOXtXdXXb3q data-wc=63>&nbsp;<strong>“</strong>Every year has been a blessing. I have great friends and great family, and I keep telling myself it’s all about the process. I had my spotlight moment from a very young age, but as you learn more and experience more you become better at what you do. I always felt really happy that I’ve never stopped working and have kept myself busy.</p><p id=eBR9hgMJ9FXc data-wc=60>“On the one hand, I’m amazed that I’ve made it this far. On the other hand – what on earth have I been doing? Get a move on, girl! Now is the time to say yes. You have to make an effort to be part of the wider world, to be open in your heart and mind to new ideas.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d0759976a679-yasmin-le-bon-3.jpg><h3><strong>Yasmin Le Bon on her wellness routine</strong></h3><p id=e4pejDSvubEf data-wc=48>With glowing skin, glossy hair and a seemingly ageless appearance, Yasmin is as in demand now as she was in her twenties. Sharing her wellness tips, she reveals: “I absolutely love putting on Headspace before bed every night. Tons of herbal tea, and yes, I am on HRT.&nbsp;</p><p id=e4i82hbZm0xZ data-wc=64>“I think it is important to enjoy exercise but it shouldn’t be a chore. You want to keep yourself in good shape. I train a couple of times a week with my fabulous trainer who has helped me through back issues. I go to the gym and am out with the dog, but I can’t push myself in the same way I used to.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a41cc003327b-240412ehyasminlebongc07017.jpg><p id=eDOBa3zYcTyo data-wc=31>“I train for a short time and it’s mostly about muscle tone. I couldn’t function without seeing my physiotherapist every couple of weeks. It’s all about maintenance rather than fighting fires.&nbsp;</p><p id=eeiVuDzlZwHJ data-wc=42>“I start every day with a probiotic drink, as gut health is crucial. I’m trying to eat more protein, I love all green vegetables and I love wine – but I’m not sure it loves me as much as it used to.&nbsp;</p><p id=edXP6CIVmUFa data-wc=25>“I take various supplements
