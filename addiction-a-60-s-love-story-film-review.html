Although he has the integrity to resist the none-too-subtle advances of a half-naked porn actress, he succumbs to the lure of heroin, quickly becoming addicted. You can pretty much guess the rest of the story, as Max finds himself in a harsh downward spiral involving drugs, a menacing gangster (Michael <span data-scayt_word=Badalucco data-scaytid=10>Badalucco</span>), and a tightening federal investigation. But thanks in part to the tough love of his Old World grandma (Carol Kane), he eventually gets on the straight and narrow path.</p><p>First-time director <span data-scayt_word="Steinsiek's" data-scaytid=11>Steinsiek’s</span> previous cinematic experience lies largely in the special effects realm — he was a two-time finalist on <span data-scayt_word="Syfy's" data-scaytid=13>Syfy’s</span> Face Off, and his credits include The Amazing Spider-Man and <span data-scayt_word=Sharknado data-scaytid=14>Sharknado</span> 2&nbsp;— which no doubt explains his depiction of Max’s drug experiences in a <span data-scayt_word=trippy data-scaytid=15>trippy</span>, psychedelic fashion that includes faces melting off.
