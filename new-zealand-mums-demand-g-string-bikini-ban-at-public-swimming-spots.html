Kayla Edwards started a debate when she posted her concerns on social media about the swimwear.
She told NZME she felt uncomfortable taking her family swimming at Spa Thermal Park, a popular public reserve for locals and tourists alike, because others there didn’t know what “appropriate” swimwear was."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I have enough self-love to do that clothed respectfully,” she said.</p><p>She apologised to anyone who felt belittled but said her opinion hadn’t changed.</p><p>“Maybe it is good that people are stirred to consider their moral standards,” she said.</p><p>Another Taupō mother, Renee Gray, backed Ms Edwards.</p><p>She said she had often seen “G-string type bikinis” in the reserve.</p><p>She said her daughter thought the swimwear was rude “as I’ve taught her about dressing modestly”.</p><p>Ms Gray said she also often saw people “undressing right by the swimming spot instead of going up the walkway to use the changing rooms”.</p><p>She was “horrified” one day when a middle-aged man “got out of the water and pulled his shorts down exposing (himself])’ next to her family.</p><p>“My daughter was disgusted being exposed to a man … and put her hand over her eyes,” Ms Gray said.</p><p>“I do think council should put signage to say no nudity or undressing at local beaches.”</p><p>Other locals had no issue with skimpy swimwear.</p><p>Bonnie Petrie, a Taupō resident of 15 years, told NZME “as long as private bits were covered, what does it matter?”</p><p>The former pole dancer and mother of twin girls said she “got naked in front of both women and men at least three nights a week and did shows (for) some of the boating companies 10 years ago”.</p><p>“They certainly weren’t complaining, it was entertainment not sexualisation,” Ms Petrie said.</p><p>She said she had seen “a few others down at the lake wear G-strings, sunbathing mainly … and once a lady with her bikini top undone but face down on her blanket”.</p><p>Ms Petrie said women wanted respect “to breastfeed their babies in public without being looked at as lewd or inappropriate” but the post was “the complete opposite”.</p><p>Another Taupō mother, who did not want to be named, told NZME she saw “a lot of people prancing around half-naked” in the district.</p><p>“I’ve seen men in mankinis, women walking around in G-string bikinis and even the odd naked person getting changed in public. It’s disgusting and it has to stop,” she said.</p><p>She said her husband hated seeing it and most of her friends felt the same way.</p><p>“Yesterday two girls were walking into town in bikinis. How is this acceptable? It makes me damn right mad … I know they say ‘if you have it, flaunt it’ but this is ridiculous.”</p><p>Taupō solo dad Craig Smith disagreed with Ms Edwards’ concerns and said he had heard of people being abused over their swimwear.</p><p>“Small swimwear is definitely the fashion and it was everywhere in Napier where I visited last week and here at the lake as well. G-strings or pulling bikini bottoms high so the butt is showing is definitely very prevalent now,” he said.</p><p>Kinloch father Jason McIver laughed when he saw the post.</p><p>“Taupō is a warm, sunny, geothermal spot so seeing G-strings and breasts is nothing shocking … I try to make sure that my kids don’t see nudity as bad and that it doesn’t need to be sexualised,” he said.</p><p>In a brief comment, the Taupō District Council said it had not received any complaints about skimpy swimwear or public nudity at council-owned swimming sites in the last year.</p><p>Taupō DeBretts Spa Resort operations manager Mirela Petrar said the privately owned facility did not have a policy on G-strings.</p><p>“We are a family-orientated business but to my knowledge, we haven’t had anyone raise concerns,” she said.</p><p>“We have private pools if people want to be romantic or in a quiet area.”</p><p><i>This article originally appeared on the <a class=body-link href=#>New Zealand Herald </a>and was reproduced with permission</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ706uYr52cZMGzrdWeo2atoJmutbHSaKCnm5mZsq%2FA0mierKyinruoecOemZqslWLAsbjIrapmrJGqvW6%2F1qKkpp2iqHquwcxmmpqknKh6p7vRZpmapl2WwW681JujoptdqL2wwNJopZ6vo2LAtbvRsmaecZVmfqSykZptb56Ubq6nrZObanJvYWawpLKVa5ubaw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./most-famous-political-quotes-from-the-uk-that-made-history.html><span>←</span><span>Most famous political quotes from the UK that made history</span></a>
