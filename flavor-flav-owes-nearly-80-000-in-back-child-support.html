Flav has been spending time with his son, and he and Kate have decided to give Jason&nbsp;his last name-- Drayton. The two have also made arrangements for custody as well as child support.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to TMZ, the former reality television star&nbsp;has agreed to pay $3,000 a month in child support-- which he's been doing as promised. However, being that Flav just started the payments, he missed out on the child's first two years. During that period of time, Kate paid for&nbsp;numerous expenses-- including medical bills.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The total&nbsp;cost Flav is looking at comes to $78,704. As claimed by Kate's family, the ex-Public Enemy rapper was supposed to pay the amount last month, but he has not done so yet.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">TMZ&nbsp;caught up with Flav, and he assured the outlet that he would be paying off his debt soon. He claimed that he's working with an accountant in order to get his finances together.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He also added that he's doing all that he can to be in his son's life.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZ4F2fJhmnaWZpqS%2FbrLLmq1mp6eawG66xJqppbFdqIVxeY9pZ2ahnmKvoq%2FKZpqhoZyZerTBz6mmq6xdo7K4vw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dasara-trailer-maas-ka-baap.html><span>←</span><span>Dasara Trailer: Maas Ka Baap!</span></a>
