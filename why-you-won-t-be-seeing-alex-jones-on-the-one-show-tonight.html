Last week, Alex, 41, was particularly excited to welcome Dolly Parton to the green sofa. "Dolly Friday!!! Thanks @greg_james for the pic!!!" she wrote alongside the group selfie on Instagram.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=ekcS7kwIwLdlp data-wc=72>In recent weeks, Alex has also interviewed Cheryl and Oti Mabuse from , and Matt and Luke Goss from Bros. Uploading a photo with Cheryl and Oti, Alex wrote: "Lovely to have these girls on tonight, the live final of #greatestdancer sound ah-mazing!!! Nice to compare notes on our little boys with @cherylofficial. P.s This dress is not maternity but stretches with you, so a goodie for an expanding bump!"</p><p id=ed3vm-RavtEIo data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Christine Lampard opens up about baby Patricia's birth</a></p><p id=evRxdAs_iTM2P data-wc=64>The pregnant TV star has been <a class=hm-link href=#>showing off her baby bump</a> in a range of stylish wear. Alex, who is expecting her second child with husband Charlie Thomson, recently admitted that she has been <a class=hm-link href=#>living in dungarees</a> to accommodate her changing figure. In January, she told her Instagram followers: "Dungar's have made a comeback. This is now me until the end of this pregnancy!

"Loneliness is one of the more unexpected feelings that can accompany motherhood, especially in the early days," she wrote. "I know I felt it back in the first stages with Teddy when his dad had gone back to work, mum had gone back to wales and my friends were busy getting on with their own lives whilst I was too scared to leave the house with a newborn."</p><p id=eW9-E1Tbc6RXG data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>The best royal family curtsies from Kate to Meghan</a></strong></p><p id=eQ5Xv8iSXiz6M data-wc=82>She continued: "It gets better of course, and with confidence comes the ability to socialise with other mums. Some feel lonely at later stages though and it can creep up on you when you least expect it. If you have a friend with a baby who you know is home alone all day and you can pop in for 15 mins for a cuppa, do it. It'll make all the difference. There's not much a cuppa and a chat can't sort out."</p><p id=exyPsb2I1VBdw data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
