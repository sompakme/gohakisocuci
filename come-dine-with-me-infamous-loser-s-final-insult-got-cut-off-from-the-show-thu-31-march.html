Dear Lord, what a sad little life, Jane.”</p><p>“You ruined my night completely, so you could have the money.

In fact, I couldn’t look directly at it – that’s why I was staring off into the distance during his whole rant.&nbsp;</p><p>“You can see me look up at one point to make eye contact with the producer, as if to plead with him, ‘Can’t you shut the camera off?’ Of course they wouldn’t, because the producers were probably getting exactly what they wanted.”</p><p>Nonetheless, Adam decided not to make a big fuss about the situation and remained silent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmLWius2eo2ZsX5i8rrGMnaCnnV2strW0jKacZqSfqLKzecWipZqkXZ67tMHLrWScraRivKeyjJ%2BpqKVdqLWww4ysmJ1lnJ7BtbjEZqOinpVit6K6xA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./you-got-it-by-roy-orbison-chords-and-melody.html><span>←</span><span>You Got It by Roy Orbison Chords and Melody</span></a>
