"I'm very proud that I got to be in 'Apollo 13' ... I felt like that was really a privilege," Clint told <a href=#>Bullz-Eye.com</a> in 2008. Clint was forthright with his older brother about wanting to be in the space drama. "I more than asked to be in the film–I told him," Clint recalled to the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a> in 1995. "I knew I was perfect to play one of those NASA guys." The actor had appeared in many of his brother's films up to that point, including "Cocoon," "Backdraft," and "The Paper."</p><p dir=ltr>Landing a role in one of Ron's movies is not as straightforward for Clint as simply asking his brother. "I have to lobby him, because I'm an actor trying to get work," he told the Times. Sometimes, the director cannot envision his younger brother being part of a project, and Ron passes on including him. "But there have been plenty of parts I wanted that he just hasn't seen me doing," Clint said.</p><p dir=ltr>Besides working alongside his brother, Clint is known for his prolific on-screen output. "I've only turned down a couple of jobs in my life," he admitted to the <a href=#>AV Club</a>&nbsp;on October 11.&nbsp;This has led to Clint enjoying a wonderfully eclectic career from notable comedies to sci-fi and horror projects.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2ppa39ye9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2nvK95x6iumqqUqHqjvs6tn56qXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stanley-tucci-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Stanley Tucci Net Worth 2024</span></a>
