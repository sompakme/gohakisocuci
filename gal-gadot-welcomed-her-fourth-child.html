On Wednesday, the Wonder Woman actress announced the exciting news on Instagram with a sweet photo of her holding the newest addition to their family: Ori.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the image, the baby girl is swaddled in a blanket with a striped hat on her head while lying on Gadot's chest. The actress, who is sitting in a hospital bed, wrapped her arms around the baby and pressed her face against the little one's head.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My sweet girl, welcome," Gadot wrote before opening up about her difficult pregnancy. "The pregnancy was not easy and we made it through. You have brought so much light into our lives, living up to your name, Ori, which means ‚Äòmy light‚Äô in Hebrew. Our hearts are full of gratitude."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Welcome to the house of girls.. üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è," she concluded the caption. "Daddy is pretty cool too üòâ‚ù§Ô∏è"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gadot and husband Jaron Varsano, who tied the knot in 2008, already shared three daughters, Alma, Maya, and Daniella, whom they welcomed in 2021. Ori's arrival surprised fans, as Gadot did not announce her pregnancy ahead of the birth.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This wasn't her first challenging <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pregnancy</a>, however. In a previous interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>InStyle</a> about the issues she faced during her past pregnancies. "Pregnancies are hard for me," she said in the 2022 interview. "I feel sick and have migraines. I'm not in my element."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On the other hand, however, the star actually enjoys the act of giving birth. "I would do it once a week if I could. It's so magical," she said. "And I always take epidurals, to be fair, so it's not so painful. Just the moment you feel like you're creating life, it's incredible."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xpqjZp%2BRmby1ecWorKusmGKwqbXLnWSbp6KjenmCj25tbm4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./franco-sperduti-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Franco Sperduti Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
