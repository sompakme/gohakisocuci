Mila was signed to Motown Records from 2013 to 2017, where she released two EPs, 2014's&nbsp;Made In L.A.&nbsp;and 2016's&nbsp;213. You may remember Mila J's 2014 single, "Smoke, Drink, and Break-Up," from her debut EP. Following the success of the single, Mila was featured on <a href=#>Trey Songz's</a> "Disrespectful" track. In 2017, the "Go Public" singer released her debut studio album Dopamine after parting ways with Motown and going independent, per&nbsp;<a href=#>Billboard</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Although Mila and Jhené are in two different places in their careers, the de facto "Slauson Sisters" see no competition between one another. In fact, the two joined forces to collaborate on "On The Way" for Aiko's Chilombo deluxe album. In July 2020, Jhené revealed the anticipated collaboration with her sister on Twitter, <a href=#>writing</a>, "Finally a song with my big sister @MilaJ. scorpio & pisces." Mila J, who is five years Aiko's senior, retweeted her lil sister's tweet, <a href=#>adding</a>, "Water signs do it better."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>In August 2020, Aiko revealed the real reason why the two took so long to collaborate with one another. "[Mila and I] tried to work together so many times. When we get together, though [...] we don't really talk about business. Family time is the time to just laugh, watch TV, and eat," Aiko said during a Grammys <a href=#>interview</a>. "Even though it took a long time, I think it took the time that it was supposed to take for us to come together."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGxnZn5xe8inqqKclWK3qbHNnmSaoZukwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mrqKsmGK1pr6MrKCsrJWneq61y5pko2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-m-a-celebrity-s-snoochie-shy-s-link-to-jeremy-vine-revealed.html><span>←</span><span>I'm a Celebrity's Snoochie Shy's link to Jeremy Vine revealed</span></a>
