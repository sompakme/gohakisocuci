He also reportedly said, "Make sure you wipe this off her face after the show. We don't make her up so some guy at a bar can look at her like this."</p><p>Bassett, who first <a href=#>made these claims</a> back in 2017, admitted that she didn't initially reveal Matthews' identity because she was afraid the network would retaliate, and because the behavior didn't "rise to the level of illegal sexual harassment."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanFiZoR1e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5wqGpoqtdoq61wMeerqxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shirley-rastatter-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Shirley Rastatter Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
