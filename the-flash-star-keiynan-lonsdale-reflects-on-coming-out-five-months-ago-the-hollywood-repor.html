Not faking shit anymore, not <span data-scayt_word=apologising data-scaytid=3>apologising</span> for falling in love with people no matter their gender. I’ve become bored of being insecure, ashamed, scared…no one should feel like that about themselves, especially when there is so much good life to live.”</p><p>The Hollywood Reporter caught up with Lonsdale Friday at <span data-scayt_word=GLSEN’s data-scaytid=4>GLSEN’s</span> Respect Awards: Los Angeles to find out what it’s been like since going public with his sexuality just five months ago.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>“It’s been a wonderful experience, a very welcoming experience,” he said, dismissing the long-held belief that coming out as <span data-scayt_word=LGBTQ data-scaytid=6>LGBTQ</span> can&nbsp; be a career-ender for actors. “We have the power to change that outcome ourselves, and if you come out and you’re proud of it and you’re proud of yourself, then people are proud for you. It’s infectious.”</p><p>And nothing makes Lonsdale happier than hearing from his <span data-scayt_word=LGBTQ data-scaytid=7>LGBTQ</span> fans. “I have kids contact me from Nigeria,” he said. “I’m part Nigerian, and now they can see someone on TV and reach out to me on social media from the other side of the world. It’s amazing. To hear them say they feel better about themselves, it means the world to me.”</p><p>The&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=GLSEN data-scaytid=10>GLSEN</span> gala was the first major <span data-scayt_word=LGBTQ data-scaytid=9>LGBTQ</span> event Lonsdale has attended. He was on hand to help introduce student co-host Nate <span data-scayt_word=Fulmer data-scaytid=12>Fulmer</span> and The Flash’s openly gay executive producer Greg <span data-scayt_word=Berlanti data-scaytid=13>Berlanti</span>, who presented DC Entertainment with this year’s Visionary Award.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOn6Oaq5hiwLWt0WainqGpo66vecuopayckaGybr7En6Oem6SoeqS7zKKloGWRqHqjtdKer66ZnGKzqsLEZqSopqSdwG59j25oa3BiZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./so-ruger-get-two-eyes-man-reacts-to-photo-of-singer-without-signature-eyepatch-causes-stir-o.html><span>←</span><span>So Ruger Get Two Eyes?
