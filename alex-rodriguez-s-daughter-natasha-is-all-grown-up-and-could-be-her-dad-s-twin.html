"I broke down crying like a little baby," Alex recalled on <a href=#>"CBS Mornings."</a> He also shared an emotional message for his daughter on Instagram. "As you move on from one chapter to the next, I'm most proud of who you are as a person. Honest, kind, compassionate, intuitive and wise beyond your years," he <a href=#>wrote</a>.</p><p>The year prior, Alex had said during a press conference that he really wanted Natasha to attend college at the University of Michigan, which is the alma mater of retired NFL quarterback Tom Brady. Alex tried using this connection to help him make his case. "I'm having Tom Brady talk to her to try to convince her to go to Michigan," he told reporters, per <a href=#>Detroit Free Press</a>.</p><p>Apparently, Alex's football flex was unnecessary, as Natasha already wanted to become a Wolverine. She created a vision board in 2020, and it included her goal of attending U-M. "I want to go to the University of Michigan for musical theater. It's the second-best musical theater program in the country," she explained in an <a href=#>Instagram</a> video. When Alex shared a <a href=#>post</a> celebrating his daughter making her dreams a reality, Brady <a href=#>reacted</a> with the word "Yeah" and a few praying hands and heart emoji.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtkZYRyhI6ao56wXae8pb7IoKyesl2Zrrazx62cq2WelsGiv8eaZJqknGK0s7vWp2SuqF2cvLOzxKisrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-is-my-phone-charging-slowly-7-reasons-you-might-be-facing-this.html><span>←</span><span>Why is my phone charging slowly? 7 reasons you might be facing this</span></a>
