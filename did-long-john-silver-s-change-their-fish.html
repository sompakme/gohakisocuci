 Answer
Long John Silver’s (LJS) — the largest seafood restaurant chain in the United States — is on a mission to encourage more US consumers to “Think Fish” as part of a recent brand relaunch. We were the first fish house to use Alaska Pollock, which helped to reduce overfishing in the Pacific Ocean. This was in 1989.
