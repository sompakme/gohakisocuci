The fan claims that she spotted the actor at a gas station in New Orleans, and eventually decided to approach him <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">to compliment him</a> for his work. Unfortunately, however, the conversation didn't go as she had planned. According to her, as she walked up to him and began to speak, he put his hand up and said "No," urging her to go away.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Let me just say, rudest human being alive," she began. "The f*cking celebrities make it seem like we’re f*cking roaches and rats... B*tch, I’m pumping… <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I’m at the same gas station as you, b*tch!</a> Baby, we on the same level playing field! I’m pumping the same gas you pumping right now! And you can’t even look at me!”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-disappointed-fan-calls-out-anthony-mackie-for-gas-station-encounter>Disappointed Fan Calls Out Anthony Mackie For Gas Station Encounter</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While some social media users can empathize with the fan over the undoubtedly awkward exchange, others argue that Mackie has a right to speak to whomever he wants. Countless users are coming to his defense, insisting that he was simply trying to protect his peace. "Y’all are so bothered by <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">boundaries</a> and I aspire to be just like Anthony Mackie when it comes to my private time and space," one Twitter/X commenter says.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Apparently, Mackie also has <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a track record</a> of being less than excited to be approached in public. Some suggest that fans should have learned their lesson by now. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Anthony Mackie ate that I’m sorry,"</a> another user writes. "If saying 'no' is someone being the rudest person alive… I have no hope for this world."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-social-media-users-come-to-anthony-mackie-s-defense>Social Media Users Come To Anthony Mackie's Defense</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Anthony Mackie's reaction to being approached by a fan at a gas station?
