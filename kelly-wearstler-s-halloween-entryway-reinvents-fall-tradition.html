It is, therefore, only natural that her <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/ideas/halloween-decorating-ideas>Halloween decor ideas</a> follow suit.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wfbg6RPmtKfuu3dT4yN63X-1920-80.jpg><p>Knowing <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/how-to-decorate-tastefully-for-halloween>how to decorate tastefully for Halloween</a> can often feel like a challenge – especially if your home's color scheme clashes with traditional fall colors. However, this doesn't need to stop you from celebrating the holiday.</p><p>With nothing but spray paint (and some disco balls if you truly want to follow Kelly Wearstler's lead), you can reinvent your conventional <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/ideas/fall-color-schemes>fall color scheme</a> to ensure it fits your home's style – and make a stylish statement in the process.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iKHHE2jgaFWpvUwDQbLrKX-1920-80.jpg><p>‘This display features an avant-garde assemblage of painted pumpkins in mottled monochromatic colors and anomalous shapes and sizes,' Kelly says of her <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/ideas/entryway-ideas>entryway idea</a> on <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/77757531057786143/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Pinterest</a>. The designer adds that her display '[moves] &nbsp;beyond the expected Halloween aesthetic' and replaces 'orange hues and carved pumpkins' with a more provocative talking point.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AewXwn9VVnq8GcakocTytW-1920-80.jpg><p>While the finished result is unlikely to look like any other display you will see this year, the process is not as daunting as it may seem.&nbsp;</p><p>The designer shared the steps behind her aptly-labeled 'avant-gourde entryway’ on her <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@kellywearstler/video/7156267401078836526?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>TikTok</a>, in which she spray painted pumpkins on a large piece of paper outside her home. For the completed look, she paired the freshly-colored fruit alongside the disco balls she designed with the Dutch art collective <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.rotganzen.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Rotganzen</a>.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Design expertise in your inbox – from inspiring decorating ideas and beautiful celebrity homes to practical gardening advice and shopping round-ups.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfGux89iRKnh9MqTp3xKDX-1920-80.jpg><p>Kelly Wearstler loves the holiday, and it shows. It is only natural to feel inspired by her 'avant-gourde' aesthetic – whether you replicate the entire display or just small pockets.</p><p>Perhaps the easiest way to mimic Kelly's style with ease is to pick up a white pumpkin (or pumpkins) that doesn't require painting. This will allow you to follow her monochromatic lead, whatever your home's style.&nbsp;</p><p>Interior designer <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://gilliansegaldesign.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Gillian Segal</a> agrees. She, too, is known for her black-and-white approach to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/ideas/fall-decor-ideas>fall decorating</a> – and recommends lining a row of&nbsp;white&nbsp;pumpkins up your driveway and around your front door. This will allow you to impress all who pass by your home before they get to your Wearstler-approved entryway.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvMnqqappScrrOwxKeqZ5ufonyvsdasZqSdnKHGbsPEmqmsrJyav7R5x5qjpaenmrKvecSnq6uxp5bGbrDEnKar</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-is-bretman-rock-worth.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Is Bretman Rock Worth?</span></a>
