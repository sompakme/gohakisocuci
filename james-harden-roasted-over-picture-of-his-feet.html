As you can see down below, Harden has his feet completely out, which puts him at risk for athlete's foot.</p><p>Harden is now the latest victim of the internet mob. With his feet strewn about online, everyone is giving their two cents on their condition. In the various tweets down below, you can see some of the hilarious things people had to say. "Boy James harden playing on a swollen ankle sheesh or his feet just fat," one person wrote. Another said "James Harden's feet looks like they were transplanted from a cadaver."</p><p>Overall, this is yet another example of just how ruthless the internet is. At this point, you cannot do anything without people making fun of you. Hopefully, Harden is able to roll with the punches.</p><p>Let us know what you think of this whole debacle, in the comments down below.
