But it turns out that the late banker was good friends with Billions co-creator Brian Koppelman, who on Sunday night <a href=# rel=nofollow>called Shields his “brother”</a> in a tweet: “Dedicated to Dennis Shields, our brother.”</p><p>At the time of Shields’ death, Koppelman took to Twitter to express his grief and share more insight about their friendship.</p><p>“Dennis Shields, who died this morning, was&nbsp;my close friend for 30 years. One of the smartest, most generous, people I ever came across,” the&nbsp;Ocean’s Thirteen&nbsp;scribe tweeted. “He was also one of the great storytellers in the world. And understood life’s endless absurdity in his bones. I loved him. And his family.”</p><p>According to Koppelman, Shields had a major influence on his work in Hollywood. The writer-producer had also reflected on Shields’ small part in his 2009 film The Girlfriend Experience, a project Koppelman helmed alongside Billions co-creator David Levien.</p><p>“Dennis had a huge impact on my life. But also on my work w Dave through the years. Each of our movies contains a piece of him,” Koppelman added in a follow-up tweet not long after Shields’ passing. “There would be no Grama without him. No 500 fights. And definitely no guy in a diaper in The Girlfriend Experience (that was actually Dennis in a cameo).”</p><p>On Monday morning, Shields’ ex <a href=# rel=nofollow>Frankel responded to a tweet</a> from a fan who asked how the financier was connected the hit Showtime drama. “We are all connected and have a long history,” wrote the Bravo personality, who introduced Shields to her longtime friend Koppelman years ago. “He is really missed and touched so many people’s lives.”</p><p>Billions airs on Showtime Sundays at 9 p.m.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKO1y6WgqKajYrGmsMicmK2do2LApq3SqKVmbF2lv6a5yJ6pnmWclsGmecOepaeho2LAqbXEpZusZWFmhnZ%2Fl2lm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-she-misses-and-why-she-s-happy-to-move-on-video.html><span>←</span><span>What She Misses and Why Shes Happy to Move On (Video)</span></a>
