His first known partner was <strong>actress Bridget Moynahan</strong>, with whom he had his first son, John Edward Thomas Moynahan. After ending his relationship with her (they never married),<strong> Brady began dating - and later married - Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen</strong>, with whom he had two more children, Ben and Vivian.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Tom may choose to hang out with a celebrity again</h2><p>Given the above examples, it is very likely that the <strong>next time Brady will date a woman </strong>again it will be a celebrity, be it from the world of<strong> sports, show business or fashion.</strong></p><p>The tabloids are already buzzing with <strong>some of the names that TB12 could start a relationship with</strong>, and the list isn't bad at all. Here we present you who are the women who most likely <strong>can be a potential partner</strong> of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' QB:</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Adriana Lima</h2><p>If Brady wants to make Gisele jealous, one of the favorites to do so<strong> is another Brazilian model, Adriana Lima</strong>. She is 41 years old, 1.78, has three children<strong> just like Tom and has been divorced since 2016</strong>. Watch out Gisele, that Adriana could take your place in Tom's heart.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Alessandra Ambrosio</h2><p>And if not Lima, another Brazilian supermodel <strong>could be Alessandra Ambrosio</strong>. Just like Lima, she is 41 years old, has two children, is 1.77 and is <strong>also without a partner since 2018</strong>. So the stars are arranged for TB12 to continue<strong> his sentimental life with some supermodel</strong> countrywoman of Gisele.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Amber Heard</h2><p>Johnny Depp's ex-wife is one of the <strong>most beautiful women in Hollywood</strong>, and at 36 years old she could start a relationship with Brady considering <strong>she is attracted to powerful men.</strong> But after the trial against Depp, in which she did not look very good, <strong>it would be difficult</strong> for her to make a match with Brady.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Shakira</h2><p>Both are 45 years old, <strong>have children and are coming out of breakups</strong> that were very mediatic. If Tom has a <strong>taste for South American women</strong> - remember that Gisele Bundchen is Brazilian - there is a possibility that he could <strong>set his sights on another couple from the region</strong>, such as Colombian Shakira. Betting site uStadium has Shakira at <strong>+900, the highest odds on their list, to end up with Brady.</strong></p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Kim Kardashian</h2><p>She may be the <strong>most famous bachelorette today</strong>. Although she doesn't seem to be Brady's type, if they were to couple up it would be a <strong>phenomenal media coup that would be talked about day in and day out</strong>. The possibility is a long shot, but Kim had to make the list.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqedpWeklrqxrYybmLJlkqqwpK3Nnpyrq19nfXN%2BjmpoaGlmZIN0g5NvnXKeYmuFpn%2FEcpptcGiXgXawj2efraWc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./philip-kendall-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Philip Kendall Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
