I liked how they mixed the textures and the different patterns they used. The fashion was inspired by the ’50s, and I think I’m the only one here that knows the ’50s. I made my own clothes in those days to be fashionable, so it was a blast from the past.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The house’s creative director, <a href=# id=auto-tag_maria-grazia-chiuri data-tag=maria-grazia-chiuri>Maria Grazia Chiuri</a>, paid tribute to iconic maverick women from the 1950s — not only Catherine Dior but also singers Edith Piaf and Juliette Gréco. “Singular protagonists, each of them was able, through their lifestyle, to subvert feminine stereotypes that were part of the post-war mindset,” said the house in show notes. For Chiuri, these three women are a real-life version of Valkyries, the combative Norse deities who served the god Odin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1247561152.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Many of the looks were monotone, but floral motifs were a main driver. Mottled fabric was shown entwined with a metallic thread that breathes life into the fabric, making it pliable and giving way to an abstract effect. Chiuri’s use of primary colors of ruby, emerald, topaz yellow and blue were poignant in the colorful, textured collection. Textiles like delicate, nuanced tartan were worn under coats; and poplin glistened against metallic thread.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Chiuri — who typically partners with a female artist for the set design of her shows — this time chose to work with Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos, who, according to Dior, “created a proliferation of organic forms interacting with the architecture” in designing the striking backdrop that paid homage to inspiring feminine icons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1470264505.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvSrbClnV%2BYtaK%2By6KxnmWknbKzu81moaKrn6R6pbXOq2SfmZyheri1za2cq2ViZX90edKhprBloJa%2Fqr%2BMamlsbWNohXKAmGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-you-add-tsa-precheck-after-booking-jetblue.html><span>←</span><span>Can you add TSA PreCheck after booking Jetblue?</span></a>
