She played a major role in the death of Crota, as well as Oryx, Omnigul, and Hashladun.<h2>Does Eris Morn turn evil?</h2>A unlockable in-game lore book titled The Dark Future details an alternate future timeline where the Darkness has won a decisive victory against the Traveler and the Guardian faction, and where Eris has become a powerful villain who leads a large alliance of evil beings after she is corrupted and possessed by the ...<h2>Why does Eris Morn have 3 eyes?</h2>She was trapped inside the hellmouth and wished she had the power to escape, and thus it was given to by altering her appearance too resemble the Hive so the she could move freely through the Hellmouth.

The superiority of the sword logic crumbled when Willbreaker did, as Oryx was defeated by the sword logic in Regicide and then killed in his throne world by bomb logic in King's Fall.<h2>Is the drifter a Titan?</h2>The Drifter is very old. He was reawakened by the Traveler in a mysterious time of great suffering known as the Dark Age, long before Guardians like the player were revived. He isn't a Hunter, Titan, or Warlock. He's a Lightbearer — a soul revived by the Traveler — from a different time.<h2>Is Eris Morn powerful?</h2>There is a climactic battle on the surface of the moon between these remnants and the forces of Darkness - the Hive, the Taken and an army of Dark Guardians led by Eris Morn, who at this point probably qualifies as the strongest villain seen yet in the Destiny franchise.<h2>What class is the drifter?</h2>The Drifter has no class.<h2>Does the drifter have a Ghost?</h2>The Drifter's Ghost is the nameless Ghost partnered to the Drifter.

In The Taken King, we're treated to more veiled hints about what really happened to Eris.<h2>What is Eris Morns rock?</h2>After killing an Ahamkara with Ikora, Eris began to hear voices. The two destroyed the dragon's bones, but Eris kept one as a memento — which would become her iconic, glowing rock. Eris had a fascination with the Hive, and worked with other Guardians to try and destroy their hierarchy.<h2>What did Eris look like?</h2>With a radius of about 722 miles (1,163 kilometers), Eris is about 1/5 the radius of Earth. Eris, like Pluto, is a little smaller than Earth's Moon. If the Earth were the size of a nickel, Eris would be about as big as a popcorn kernel.<h2>Is Savathun the witch queen?</h2>Savathûn, the Witch Queen, formerly known as Sathona, is a Hive god and sister to Xivu Arath, God of War and Oryx, the Taken King. Together with her two siblings, she was a progenitor of the contemporary Hive species and one of its chief gods, having made a pact with the Worms of Fundament.<h2>What does the drifter call Eris Morn?</h2>The Drifter/Eris "Moondust" Morn.<h2>Who is the most powerful Guardian in Destiny?</h2><p>The Guardians are Light bearers within Destiny.<br>...<br>Destiny: 13 Strongest Guardians, Ranked From Weakest To Most Powerful</p><li>1 Saint-14.</li><li>2 Osiris. ...</li><li>3 Ikora. ...</li><li>4 Shaxx. ...</li><li>5 Lady Efrideet. ...</li><li>6 Saladin Forge. ...</li><li>7 Shin Malphur. ...</li><li>8 Ana Bray. ...</li><h2>Who is the oldest guardian in Destiny?</h2>Saint-14 is one of the oldest Guardians in Destiny.

He and his fireteam successfully turned the tides of the Battle of Six Fronts, thus saving the city from certain death.<h2>How old is Eris morn?</h2>According to Hidden reports, Eris Morn was born in the Last City over 300 years ago, a child of civilian parents.<h2>What Guardian is drifter?</h2>The Drifter is a rogue Guardian and the host of Gambit.
