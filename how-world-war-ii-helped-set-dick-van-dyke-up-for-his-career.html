When he heard an officer mention that airmen with special talents could be given non-combat roles, Van Dyke had an epiphany. The lanky teen could sing decently well and tap dance: surely that counted as a special talent? His officers agreed, and soon Van Dyke was in the USO, dancing and entertaining the troops overseas. The role suited him so well that he never stopped. As of 2022, <a href=#>IMDb</a> still shows him making movies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDk3Fobmhfnby4edaoqaWcXayus3nIomShnZylsqV50p6rZpyZmLhuwsCnZJ2xm5p6tryMn6arZZiewG6vwKucnqpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-charlotte-flair-is-doing-after-being-slammed-on-her-face-at-wrestlemania.html><span>←</span><span>How Charlotte Flair Is Doing After Being Slammed on Her Face at WrestleMania</span></a>
