Does that complicate the issue? I’m just raising it and thinking out loud and maybe being stupid.”</p><p>Goldblum’s commentary was quickly criticized on social media, with users noting Islam is not alone in being a religion that that has historically discriminated against women and the LGBTQ community. Several users also noted that Thursday evening marked the start of Ramadan, a holy month of fasting for the religion.</p><p>The actor’s questioning opened up a meaningful conversation on the show about Islam, its treatment towards the LGBTQ community specifically, and how those like Cox who are a part of the culture live through it. RuPaul, perhaps spotting the sensitivity of the conversation, noted that “drag has always shaken the tree, so to speak.”</p><p>“There are so many different layers to this presentation. If it was ever going to be done, this is the stage to do it,” the host added.</p><p>While tearful on the runway, Cox shared that “it’s a complex issue” and she has her “own misgivings about the way LGBT people are treated in the Middle East.”</p><p>“At the same time, I am one,” Cox continued. “What is so important to me is that if you just happen to be different, then live that truth.”</p><p>While cultural norms and traditional readings of Islamic sacred text can promote a heteronormative binary of gender identification and sexual orientation, according to a recent survey by Public Religion Research Institute, more than half (52 percent) of American Muslims agreed that&nbsp;“society should approve of homosexuality.”&nbsp;</p><p>Cox continued to address how the U.S. travel ban that prohibits entry into the country from all Muslim-majority countries&nbsp;has impacted her personally. The ban has barred immigrants from Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen, as well as Cox’s home country of Iran.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>“I’m here, and I deserve to be in America just as much as anyone else.”</p><p>Thank you for your bravery, <a href=# rel=nofollow>@JackieCoxNYC</a> – we’re so happy you’re here. <a href=# rel=nofollow>#DragRace</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/aVCFXNKHHx</a></p><p>— RuPaul’s Drag Race (@RuPaulsDragRace) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 25, 2020</a></p><p>For Cox, she noted how the ban stopped her aunt from coming to the U.S. to help care for Cox’s mother. “When the Muslim ban happened, it really destroyed a lot of my faith in this country. And really hurt my family. And that’s so wrong to me,” Cox shared on the runway.</p><p>“I had to show America that you can be LGBT and from the Middle East and there’s going to be complicated shit around that and that’s okay. But I’m here and I deserve to be in America just as much as anyone else.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOo5yfnl2cvK2wwaWspmWWlrCmv4ysppyhkaF6rrHDophmmpGYuK2t0qFkoquclrpur86mpJ6mpKh6s8HPmqylq12Zv6KzjKuYnJ1dZn96fZdxaWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-grow-vanilla-beans-in-florida.html><span>←</span><span>How To Grow Vanilla Beans In Florida</span></a>
