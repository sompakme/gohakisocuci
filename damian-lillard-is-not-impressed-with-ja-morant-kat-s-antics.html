Not a good msg to send to the veteran Dubs," he wrote. "KAT waving goodbye to the crowd after blowing a 10-point lead in the 4th quarter of a series they choked leads in multiple times and basically gave away. You’d maybe see this if a team lost in the Finals on their home floor in a hard fought game, from the role players. Still remember KG crying on the bench with a towel over his head when they lost to the Lakers in 04."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As you can see down below, Damian Lillard agreed with all of these sentiments as he reposted Ball Don't Stop on Instagram, all while saying "must read caption." Needless to say, Lillard wants to see just a tiny bit of a decorum from these young stars.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you thought of the Grizzlies & T-Wolves series, in the comments section down below.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
