Viewers of the Bravo show are fully aware Georgia has been flirting with Paget, despite his being in a relationship with deckhand Ciara Duggan.</p><p>Paget has been enjoying every minute of the attention Georgia has been paying him. The <a href=#>mid-season teaser for the Below Deck spin-off</a> even showed footage of Georgia telling Paget how important he is to her.</p><h2>Georgia clarifies her relationship with Paget</h2><p>Georgia and Paget have definitely been getting along in a way that comes across as more than platonic. Yes, Paget is not innocent. He has been flirting with Georgia too, even calling her voice “sensual.”</p><p>The Daily Dish caught up with the third stew to let her <a href=#>set the record straight on their relationship.</a> Georgia revealed she has” a very sincere” friendship with Paget. She also spilled that she was friends with Ciara too during filming.</p><p>Now just because they are friends doesn’t mean Georgia wasn’t flirting with Paget this charter season.</p><p>“I mean it, it is. But I mean, like, have you heard me talk to anyone? Like, this is just how I speak,” she explained to the website.</p><h2>Georgia understand why fans think she is a flirt</h2><p>The third stew made it clear; she is not a homewrecker. She totally understands why viewers may think that about her. However, Georgia expressed that everyone in the crew spoke the same way she did on the yacht.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Below Deck (@belowdeckbravo)</a></p><p>She is also aware that she has no boundaries. It is a sentiment that Georgia admitted on a recent episode of Below Deck Sailing Yacht.</p><p>“I very much do challenge boundaries. It’s not like I’ve got a mistress personality or anything, but I can see how a woman wouldn’t like me making those kinds of jokes to their man,” she said in a confessional.</p><p>There is another thing Georgia wants viewers to know. She would never intentionally cause problems in Ciara and Paget’s relationship.</p><p>“I do have immense respect for Ciara and Paget’s relationship. I was never like, come to my cabin. It’s just stupid innuendos and jokes about laundry and underwear, and that is just what it is,” Georgia expressed to The Daily Dish.</p><p>Georgia Grobler wants Below Deck Sailing Yacht fans to know she did not cross a line with Paget Berry. The two are close friends and nothing more. It may not be the <a href=#>drama viewers of the Bravo series</a> wanted to hear, but it is Georgia’s truth.</p><p>Below Deck Sailing Yacht airs Mondays at 9/8c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5KaubDDjJ2cnKNdqK6quMinnmaxkZi1tXnGnqarn5mWeqi%2Bzpujnqpdmba0tMSsZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2strW0jKmYoJ2kYq%2BmvtGyZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ava-phillippe-sends-daily-outfit-pictures-to-mom-reese-witherspoon.html><span>←</span><span>Ava Phillippe sends 'daily outfit pictures' to mom Reese Witherspoon</span></a>
