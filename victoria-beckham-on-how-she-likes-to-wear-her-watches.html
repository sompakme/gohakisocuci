But as someone who grew up a major Spice Girls fan, who just wanted to dress like Posh, I saw the documentary series as an excuse to revisit her iconic looks—and, specifically, her incredible eye for watch styling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Victoria Beckham—who of course moved on from music to a successful next chapter as a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/health/a43645123/take-the-edge-off-victoria-beckham/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fashion and beauty mogul" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">fashion and beauty mogul</a>—had an extensive watch collection long before it became trendy. (But then, what else would you expect from someone whose father picked them up at school in a Rolls-Royce?) Now, she has partnered with Swiss luxury watchmaker Breitling on the limited-edition Chronomat Automatic 36 Victoria Beckham collection, which launched today.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The watch brand’s iconic Chronomat is popular because, like Beckham, it’s chic. (Some might even say posh.) The new collection features the Breitling logo on the dial and Beckham’s initials on the second hand, with cases in either stainless steel or yellow gold—the latter a material specifically revived by Breitling for this line, which has been limited to 1,500 pieces.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bazaar caught up with Beckham to talk about the design process with Breitling and how she likes to wear her watches.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How would you describe this collection with Breitling?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I love to collaborate with the best, and Breitling has always pushed boundaries and is redefining Swiss watchmaking. It was a real exchange—working closely with Breitling’s expert craftsmanship and know-how, and [then] bringing in my aesthetic was exciting. The team’s level of execution and construction was impressive to observe, and as a watch lover for many years, it was exciting to see how much goes into each timepiece.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How did this process differ from when you’re designing your ready-to-wear?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I have always loved a men’s watch, the weight of it, the hardware … but men’s watches can be a bit too big, so I wanted to have something that had the same look and feel, but a little smaller, with ease, whilst retaining the masculine edge to it. I really wanted it to feel effortless, despite everything being extremely considered! It was also important for me that there be very subtle nods to my brand: elegant and effortless for every day.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Recently, there has been renewed interest in watches, especially among younger fashion fans. Why do you think Gen Z is so drawn to timepieces?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The lines between men’s and women’s watches are being blurred, and I think it’s great that more and more women and younger fashion fans are interested in watches. It’s another way of self-expression.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>While you were designing these watches, how were you envisioning them being styled?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is the perfect watch for women who are looking for something versatile. It’s elevated and chic, but still has a relaxed feel to it. The mix of masculine and feminine has always been how I like to dress myself, and I am quite a minimalist at heart. These pieces can really take you from day to night and be worn with anything—I like to wear mine looser on the wrist and with some great tailoring!</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What’s your favorite way to wear watches?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’ve always loved watches and especially vintage men’s watches. I like the weight of them and to wear them a little looser, almost like a bracelet. It’s the finishing touch to any outfit, and I like to wear them with everything from jeans and the perfect white T-shirt to tailoring or eveningwear.<br></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
