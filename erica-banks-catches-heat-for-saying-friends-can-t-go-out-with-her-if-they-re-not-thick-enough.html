If she ain't thick enough, no. Hair not did good enough? Nope. Can't dress? Nope. Skinny? Nope! [laughs]."</p><p>"It's like, I don't feel like I'm discriminating, I just want a certain type of look," the rap diva shared. "She could be the sweetest girl I've ever met in my life, but if she don't look the part, I don't want her to come. It's just not the vibe I'm on."</p><p>Banks said that it's fine for girls who don't meet her beauty standards "to come to the cookout [or] the listening party," but when it comes to the club, she feels as though "bitches gotta look a certain way."</p><p>The recording artist has been hit with a considerable amount of backlash in the hours since the video hit the internet, with people leaving comments like "Did your friends treat you this way <a href=# rel>pre-surgery</a>? Ew energy, so musty," and "This is unBBLievable!"</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">A post shared by The Neighborhood Talk (@theneighborhoodtalk)</a></p><p>Are you on Erica Banks' side?
