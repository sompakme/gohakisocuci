The actress then left her home to stay at a friend's house and avoid the intense media attention.Since Cory's death, Lea has been grieving alongside his family. She released a statement thanking family, friends and fans for their support and updating them on her whereabouts. "Lea is deeply grateful for all the love and support she's received from family, friends and fans," it read. "Since Cory's passing, Lea has been grieving alongside his family and making appropriate arrangements with them. "They are supporting each other as they endure this profound loss together. We continue to ask the media to respect the privacy of Lea and Cory's family.
