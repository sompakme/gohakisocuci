As Alexa told <a href=#>Southern Living</a>, the two first connected at a Bible study but were&nbsp;"just friends," partly because, as Alexa admitted to <a href=#>People</a>, Carlos "was everything I wasn't looking for." She'd sworn to never date an actor, but she soon learned he was "incredible" and "everything I needed." As she said in&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, their union works because "we both have the same foundation so we are reaching for the same goals in our family." A family that grew with the arrival of <a href=#>son Ocean</a> in 2016, son Kingston in 2019, and daughter Rio in 2021, per <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>.</p><p>They also share their love of acting and like mixing business with pleasure. "We always said, if we can, we're going to work together on every project," the "Spy Kids" alum told Southern Living, so their family "is never separated." Enter Hallmark, which has been "so accommodating" because "anytime there's an opportunity for us to work together, they bring it up." That would explain why they've co-starred in five Hallmark films: "<a href=#>Enchanted Christmas</a>," "<a href=#>Love at Sea</a>" (which even has <a href=#>a cameo from Ocean</a>!), and three Picture Perfect Mysteries: "<a href=#>Newlywed and Dead</a>," "<a href=#>Dead Over Diamonds</a>," and "<a href=#>Exit, Stage Death</a>." As Alexa told <a href=#>E! News</a>, working for the network has been "a blessing, for sure."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGhlaYNxe8eao6Wlkae4bq%2FHmqWnnZxiwLWt0axksKCfYq6zsYymmKuqmZqxbrXNZqmemZxiuaqyxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dominic-thiem-dating-german-dancer-and-circus-performer-lili-paul-roncalli-as-pair-share-loved-up-in.html><span>←</span><span>Dominic Thiem dating German dancer and circus performer Lili-Paul Roncalli as pair share loved-up In</span></a>
