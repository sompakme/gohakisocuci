By Chris Snellgrove | Updated 8 months ago Back in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, we saw Michael Cera play the titular character as he battled seven evil exes to win the privilege of dating Ramona Flowers (played to perfection by Mary Elizabeth Winstead).

In real life, Cera never dated Winstead, but he did end up dating another costar, Aubrey Plaza, and things got more serious than you might expect. According to <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the two were once driving through Las Vegas and hatched a plan to get married by one of the city’s many Elvis impersonators.</p><p>Obviously, the two of them didn’t get married. In fact, they broke up after about a year and a half of dating. But if you’re worried about Michael Cera and Aubrey Plaza getting their young hearts broken, don’t be: they originally wanted to get married by Elvis as part of a joke and simply didn’t end up going through with it.</p><p>What was the idea, then? According to Cera, he and Aubrey Plaza were going to get married and “then get a divorce right away, so we could call each other ‘my ex-husband’ and ‘my ex-wife’ at like … 20.” Honestly, it would have been a pretty funny bit, but it seems like both of the actors decided early on not to go through with it.</p><p>After dating for about a year and a half, Michael Cera and Aubrey Plaza ended up calling quits on their relationship. However, it seems like the two had a very amicable breakup: in the same interview where Cera dropped the bombshell news about nearly getting married by Elvis, he praised Plaza, noting how she has “always been so committed to everything that she does.”</p><p>On top of her acting skills, Cera also pointed out that it is both “surprising” and “amazing” that “she’s producing and putting together projects” such as Ingrid Goes West.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aubrey-plaza-legion-glasses-900x506.jpg><p>In the years since they first started dating on the set of Scott Pilgrim, Michael Cera and Aubrey Plaza have both kept busy with many different projects. For his part, Cera has appeared in memorable movies such as This Is the End, The Lego Batman Movie, and even Twin Peaks: The Return (we love you, Wally Brando).</p><p>As for Plaza, she has stayed relentlessly busy starring in everything from lowbrow comedies like Dirty Grandpa and the series Little Demon all the way to highbrow dramatic shows such as The White Lotus.</p><p>Like everyone else, we’re very excited that Michael Cera and Aubrey Plaza will be reuniting for the <a class=wpil_keyword_link title=upcoming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked href=# rel=noopener>upcoming</a> Scott Pilgrim anime, joining the other major cast members who will be reprising their roles from the live-action film. While we expect much of the animated screen time will be dominated by Cera’s title character, we’re hoping to see a lot more of Plaza’s Julie Powers.</p><p>If nothing else, we’re hoping they continue the gag of her foul language getting covered up by both a quick screech as well as a black box covering her mouth.</p><p>Ultimately, the story of Michael Cera and Aubrey Plaza nearly getting married just to get divorced is in line with their bizarre sense of humor. Sadly, both of the stars have since gotten married to other partners just as Winstead married <a href=#>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> himself, so even if you could rustle up the world’s best Elvis impersonator, you won’t have a shot.</p><p>Cera even welcomed his first child into the world just last year, so fans must now face something even more intimidating than an army of evil exes: the inevitable passage of time, underscored by the horrifying fact that the Scott Pilgrim actor is now old enough to be a father who is rapidly approaching middle age.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iZpZe%2FpsWMqaOaspFiuqqvx5qcpWWTmr%2BiecSlraKrXp3Brrg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alissa-ashley-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Alissa Ashley Net Worth</span></a>
