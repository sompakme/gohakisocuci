She’s got a bruise on her nose and a black eye, but between that and that slugfest they had in the middle towards the end, it was great. My hat’s off to Rhea Ripley. She let Ashley hit her as hard as I used to hit Steamboat. That’s what makes it real as opposed to Seth Rollins and Logan Paul laying on their back side by side and slapping each other in the chest. Come on. They’re both better than that. That looked bad compared to Ashley chopping Rhea. Come on. Let’s get serious.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Despite the injury, Ric had high praise for Charlotte and Rhea’s match. He claimed that they had the best match at WrestleMania and received texts from people who know the industry praising their performance.</p><p>“They had the best match at WrestleMania. Let’s get serious. If I showed you the people that text me, and I’ll never violate their privacy, that they sent about Charlotte and Rhea, you’d be amazed, and these are people that know, not people that speculate.”</p><p>While Charlotte’s fall may have been a scary moment, it appears that she is okay and continuing to perform at a high level.</p><p>What are your thoughts on Ric Flair’s comments about Charlotte’s injury at WrestleMania 39?
