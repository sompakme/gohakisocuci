According to the article, it's cool these days to have tiny tits. As Elisabeth Dale (née Squires), who wrote&nbsp;Boobs: A Guide to Your Girls,&nbsp;told the&nbsp;Times,&nbsp;there has been "a huge surge in Web sites and online retailers that specialize in smaller bra sizes in a very empowering way." (Check out&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://www.evesappleslingerie.com/brand/sexy-bras referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>evesappleslingerie.com</a>, for example.) The&nbsp;Times&nbsp;writer goes on to say: "These days, it's not uncommon for women with modest busts to flaunt what little they've got with a deep V-neck cut or a halter top." She also notes that there are a number of Facebook groups peopled by flat-chested and small-breasted women who are proud of their barely-there mammaries.</p><p>(Along somewhat similar lines,&nbsp;The Daily Beast&nbsp;recently ran&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-08-25/breast-implant-removal-heidi-montag-more-plastic-surgery-regrets/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>a story about all the celebrities who were so unhappy with the size of their boobs</a>&nbsp;after they got implants that they decided to have them removed.)</p><p>I myself have B-cups only on very good days (i.e., days when I stuff some socks down there). These come in handy when I exercise, because they mostly stay put — though I prefer jogging with a sports bra, I could get away with just wearing a tight tank top. But I do often wish I had bigger boobs, because I think they'd make me look better in lots of outfits — particularly dresses and skirts with tight tops.</p><p>But the dudes I've dated seemed to think my A-sized boobs were A-okay. One guy said, for instance, "They fit pretty well in one hand — anything bigger would just be wasted."</p><p>Is there anything much better than that to be said on the topic? I don't think so.</p><p>Nonetheless, I asked a few of my male friends to weigh in on the question: Does size matter when it comes to breasts?</p><p><strong>Friend No. 1: BIG BOOBS ARE MOSTLY&nbsp;</strong><strong>VISUALLY</strong><strong>&nbsp;APPEALING</strong></p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><p>"I've noticed that the greatest thing about bigger breasts is that they can make a woman&nbsp;look&nbsp;great. They're not bad to touch, either, but I do think the main appeal is aesthetic. That said, an attractive woman with smaller breasts can be hot, too."</p><p><strong>Friend No. 2: SMALL TO NONEXISTENT BOOBS ARE BEST IN ALL RESPECTS</strong></p><p>"I don't know how to explain this, but I like small to nonexistent breasts best to look at it, and to touch. I don't like big ones at all."</p><p><strong>Friend No. 3: BIG BOOBS WILL PROBABLY SAG — AND THAT'S A TURNOFF</strong></p><p>Similarly, another friend told me: "Since I want to get married someday — and to&nbsp;stay&nbsp;married — and to have a wife I want to f*ck 'til one of us dies — I do think about how any woman's breasts are going to age. And when I see breasts that are too big, I can't help but think about how much they're going to sag eventually. Maybe I am scarred from a hookup with a woman whose breasts were especially droopy. But this is what goes on in my brain."</p><p>Gents out there, feel free to weigh in on this topic.</p><p>And ladies: Do you like your small ones just fine? Or do you have big ones — and think women with smaller boobs have life much easier?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaKuVrXqtu9WeZpptY2iCcLnEp2SpqpWbsrN50qaYpaRdl7%2BmrdKtZKyhqprAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luis-miguel-c%C3%B3mo-qued%C3%B3-su-famosa-mansi%C3%B3n-en-acapulco-tras-el-hurac%C3%A1n-otis.html><span>←</span><span>Luis Miguel: Cmo qued su famosa mansin en Acapulco tras el huracn Otis?</span></a>
