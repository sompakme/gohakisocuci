During a recent interview, the internet personality weighed in on Kendrick bringing rival gangs together for his upcoming "Not Like Us" music video.

Them n****s just found something to dance to.” White also went on to argue that Kendrick's effort to promote up-and-coming artists at "The Pop Out" fell flat. “They ain’t going nowhere. Ain’t nobody finna to listen to no up-and-coming L.A. artists, but L.A. artists in their neighborhood. Don’t nobody want to hear that sh*t," he said.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-charleston-white-thinks-kendrick-lamar-only-brought-rival-gangs-together-for-optics>Charleston White Thinks Kendrick Lamar Only Brought Rival Gangs Together For Optics</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere in the conversation, White made it clear that he supported <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> amid his viral rap beef with Kendrick. He also insisted that he's a far better artist overall, and claimed that it's not even a close call. "Let me just say this," he began. "Drake a way better rapper. I know Drake’s songs, I ain’t never heard a n***a in Texas pull up bumping Kendrick’s sh*t or nothing. I was just going against the grain. Let’s be clear. Kendrick <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">can’t compare</a> unless you like twisting your fingers up like the r******* people. That’s the only way you gonna like Kendrick, you’ve got to be r*******."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Charleston White's cynical take on Kendrick Lamar?
