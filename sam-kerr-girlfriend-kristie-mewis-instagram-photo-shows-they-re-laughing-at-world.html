The photo showed the pair celebrating while cuddling up on a couch.</p><p>Krieger posted a photo of the pair on her Instagram stories where Mewis appears to be deliberately covering Kerr’s left hand. In another video posted, Mewis, 32, appears to be covering her engagement finger with the sleeve of her top.</p><p>In a sign the pair are having a laugh while the world is in a spin over their relationship status, Mewis posted a third photo on her own Instagram stories on Friday with Kerr and herself both hiding their hands.</p><p>The photos have only poured more fuel on the burning rumours.</p><p>The Matildas superstar and her USA representative girlfriend have been together since 2021 and regularly post loved up pictures together on social media.</p><p>A fortnight ago, the pair shared photos of<a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=d7d704c28449a4e7971b9a6564dc93d2 data-tgev-label=sport data-tgev-metric=ev> Kerr’s 30th birthday </a>before each returned to their respective teams — Mewis for Gotham FC in the NWSL in New Jersey, and Kerr for Chelsea in the Women’s Super League.</p><p>The NWSL is nearing its finals while the WSL has yet to start as the clubs continue pre-season training.</p><p>So while they should be on the other side of the world to each other, Kerr set tongues wagging, posting a picture of the New York skyline, we would assume from New Jersey, on Tuesday.</p><p>The plot thickened when paired with a post from Gotham FC featuring Mewis and a few of her teammates in a promotional video for EA Sports’ FC 24 video game where the players guessed their stats.</p><p>The video was funny enough but it was hard not to have your eyes drawn to the enormous diamond on the ring on Mewis’ left hand ring finger, the traditional finger for engagement and wedding bands.</p><p>While the pair have not made any official announcements, it hasn’t stopped fans from getting excited for the couple.</p><p>Kerr and Mewis went public with their relationship in 2021 after the Tokyo Olympics.</p><p>“We’re not private people,” Kerr told Gaffer.</p><p>“I like sharing my story. I like sharing who I am outside of football.”</p><p>Kerr added that it was important to her to be with someone who understood the demands of football, particularly when they play on the opposite sides of the world.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Mewis added: “I think just being out and being two girls in love, I think if we can change one or two people’s lives, and the way that they feel about each other and how comfortable they feel, then that means a lot to me.</p><p>“I love to share my relationship on social media.”</p><p>The pair won over fans at the World Cup, <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=64ffa4ca8ca226d8f0cafa88815caf42 data-tgev-label=sport data-tgev-metric=ev>sharing a photo dump of their time together</a>, as well as being snapped <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=a03efdcb67587777f313aa8fb32f1c3b data-tgev-label=sport data-tgev-metric=ev>celebrating with a kiss </a>as Australia went deep in the tournament.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ70qmmq6xfm7ywwMGao6VnoJ28tbuMqaasnV2otbDD0maqmqVdoLKzvoypmKusnpq%2Fbq3RnmSlmaWctaq6xmaYrWWRobluu8VmrKxnnprEtHnSraarsV9shnWxkHGZb25kbbKiscBqZ21xY5d%2Fo36UapxvmWWZfQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicki-minaj-flawlessly-handled-a-major-wardrobe-malfunction-on-stage.html><span>←</span><span>Nicki Minaj Flawlessly Handled A Major Wardrobe Malfunction On Stage</span></a>
