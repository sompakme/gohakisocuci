I'll spin you around, won't let you fall down.
Would you let me lead?
You can step on my feet.
Give it a try, it'll be alright.The room's hush, hush, and now's our moment.
Take it in feel it all and hold it.
Eyes on you, eyes on me.
We're doing this right.
'Cause lovers dance when they're feeling in love.
Spotlight shining, it's all about us."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
