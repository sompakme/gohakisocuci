It wasn’t noted exactly what ballpark of money we’re talking about here, but Mandy Rose was under a WWE main roster deal as NXT Women’s Champion.</p><p>Fans who want to view Mandy Rose’s premium content must subscribe to her monthly service for $30. Then they will have an opportunity to purchase content ala carte, and it isn’t cheap. We’ve seen Mandy Rose fans drop $200 on one photo in the past. Needless to say, that money adds up.</p><p><a href=#>Mandy Rose knew that WWE</a> didn’t want her posting this kind of content. It was quite evident by how she tried to squash the story from gaining momentum. It is unclear how many chances WWE gave her, but it resulted in her termination in the end.</p><p>We’ll have to see what’s next for Mandy Rose, but she will likely keep up her premum content hustle, because she doesn’t have a morality clause to worry about now.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this situation with Mandy Rose?
