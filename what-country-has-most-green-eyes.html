The different variants of genes are referred to as alleles. The gey gene has one allele that gives rise to green eyes and one allele that gives rise to blue eyes.</p><h2>Are my eyes green or hazel?</h2>A green eye usually has a solid green hue with more or less a single color throughout the iris. Hazel eyes are multi-colored, with a shade of green and a characteristic burst of brown or gold radiating outwards from around the pupil.<h2>Can two blue eyed parents have a green eyed child?</h2>First, the answer is yes to both questions: two blue-eyed parents can produce green or brown-eyed children.

It is particularly dangerous for eyes to change from brown to green, or from blue to brown. Major changes in the iris' pigment can indicate illness, such as: Horner's syndrome.<h2>Are green eyes attractive?</h2>The survey concluded that the majority appeal is due to the unusualness of the eye color. The conclusion: Green eyes are considered attractive because it's a rare color. Common eye colors like brown, blue, even black, are typically seen all around because of its pigmentation.<h2>What color eyes see better in the dark?</h2>While blue eyes are more sensitive to light during the day, people with blue eyes tend to see better at night – unless there are bright lights. In that case, the lack of melanin makes them as sensitive to light at night as they are during the day.<h2>What are considered beautiful eyes?</h2>Hazel eyes have also been voted as one of the most attractive eye colours and can, therefore, be argued to have the best of both worlds, health and beauty.

Grey eyes are also a rare eye color.<h2>Does eye color Affect Vision?</h2>Eye color doesn't significantly affect the sharpness of your vision, but it can affect visual comfort in certain situations. It all comes down to the density of the pigment melanin within your iris, which determines what colors of light are absorbed or reflected.<h2>Can a blue eyed and brown-eyed parents have a green-eyed child?</h2>Now mix in a third green allele, which is dominant to blue, but recessive to brown. If the brown-eyed mother carried the green allele (bG), she could pass the green allele on 50% of the time, so when married up with the father's blue allele, they could have a green-eyed child.<h2>Can 2 brown-eyed parents have a blue eyed child?</h2>For two parents with brown eyes to have a blue-eyed child, both parents must genetically be Bb.
