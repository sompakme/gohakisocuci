<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>How many romances can Geralt have?</h1></header><section class=post-content><span><span>Geralt has <b>two main romance options</b> in The Witcher 3: Yennefer and Triss. Ultimately, only one of these sorceresses can be Geralt's partner by the time that you finish the game and its expansions.</span></span><h2>Can Geralt romance multiple people?</h2>Geralt can romance them all with no repercussions on the others — this even pertains to his long-term goals with Triss and Yennefer.<h2>What happens if you romance more than one person in The Witcher 3?</h2>If you attempt to equally romance both Triss and Yennefer throughout the game you will lose both. Later in the game, after helping Triss and Yennefer in Novigrad before the search for the Sunstone they will attempt to seduce Geralt together, suggesting he can have both of them.<h2>How many people can you romance in The Witcher 2?</h2>Raise a Floppa - The Loop<p>In The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, there are five confirmed, discrete romance options (though the term 'romance' is used loosely, since three of the encounters in question are essentially casual sex).</p><h2>Who all can Geralt sleep with?</h2>Throughout the course of his adventure, Geralt will encounter characters that he can romance - and who will attempt to romance him. While both Yennefer and Triss Merigold may be his one-time lovers, their intentions are unknown - and there are plenty of other fish in the sea.<h2>Witcher 3: Geralt Hasn't Slept with Ciri, Philippa and Margarita. Though the last one has it coming.</h2><p></p><h2>Can Geralt sleep with Rosa?</h2>No, she's not a romance candidate, it really seems like it at first but in the end it won't happen.<h2>Does romancing Keira affect Yennefer?</h2>Romancing Keira has no impact on the rest of the game and the other romance options that Geralt can pursue.<h2>Who should Geralt end up with?</h2>If players complete the Blood and Wine expansion, Yennefer will be the one to end up with Geralt at his new property - unless players tried to romance both Triss and Yennefer, which will lead to Ciri or Dandelion showing up instead. But there is no expressly correct choice for romance in The Witcher 3.<h2>Is Ciri a romance option?</h2>Ciri also has some romance options in the new game, and it's up to you to choose who she'll end up with. So, buckle up and check out your options – and how to achieve them.<h2>Did Geralt slept with a succubus?</h2>Regis had a romantic relationship with the very same succubus that Geralt agreed not to kill, while he, the witcher and their companions were in Beauclair. Due to Regis' romance and thanks to focusing her attention on himself during their stay, it was Geralt to whom the disposal of the "monster" was attributed.<h2>Does sleeping with Sasha affect Yen?</h2>As for any other female character in the rest of the game (including the expansions) relationship with them (if you can even call it that) has no impact with either Yen or Triss.<h2>Can you sleep with Keira and Yennefer?</h2>The earlier encounter with Yennefer during the funeral feast doesn't count even if you romanced Triss, nor do other flings in the game (Keira, etc.) No, you can actually sleep with all of them while also choosing Yen.<h2>Can you meet Yennefer after main story?</h2>All the people you can see after the game are: Roche, Dandelion, Yennefer or Triss ( depending on who you choose) Zoltan, maybe Djikstra, Thaler, Ves and Ciri if you didnt love anyone and got the best ending. You can also see Keira Metz at kaer morhen at the hill near the exercise that Ciri trained on.<h2>Does Geralt love Triss or Yennefer?</h2>The former is Geralt's long-running love interest, and in the books, it's Yennefer who Geralt loves. In other words, this is considered the more canon choice. However, for the games, CD Projekt Red explored the relationship between Triss Merigold and Geralt, especially in the series' second game.<h2>Does killing Keira make a difference?</h2>Once you defeat her, Geralt will burn the notes. It's not the most fleshed out ending, but it does give you an additional boss battle. Plus, Keira dying in combat is better than her getting executed and her corpse put on display.<h2>Does romancing Triss affect Yennefer?</h2>WARNING: You can't romance both Triss AND Yennefer<p>If you choose to try and romance both Triss and Yennefer, then you will end up losing both of them. That being said it is an entertaining story so if you aren't attached to either of them feel free to give it a try. Just don't say we didn't warn you.</p><h2>How do I stop Triss from leaving without romance?</h2>The only way to get Triss to stay with immediately after she's gotten all of the mages on the boat is to say you love her and start the romance with her. Otherwise she will always leave and then be called back by Yen when things get ready for the battle at Kaer Morhen.<h2>Does Yennefer cheat on Geralt?</h2>9 YENNEFER'S ATROCITY: Cheating On Geralt<p>For starters, there are multiple instances in the story where Yennefer has slept with people behind Geralt's back, causing the witcher no end of grief when he found out.</p><h2>Did Triss cheat on Geralt?</h2>Book wise... ehhh... the whole Triss and Geralt romance was a sort of cheating by Triss(and it closely resembles game version of the event). By her own admition, she was fully aware that it was very likely neither Geralt or Yennefer would ever forgive her for that.<h2>Did Yennefer get pregnant?</h2>In fact, in the novels (and in the show) both Yennefer and Geralt are incapable of having biological children. For Geralt, the show affords him a wide landscape of emotions — his story isn't pegged to his ability to father children.<h2>Does kissing Shani affect Yennefer?</h2>No, romancing Shani has no effect on your relationship with Yen.<h2>Should I stop Keira from going to Radovid?</h2>If you're aiming for the Full Crew achievement, you must send Keira to Kaer Morhen as part of getting the achievement. If you don't let Keira go to Radovid you won't be able to do the secondary quest A Final Kindness.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8eormalkaPGbr7Oppinm5WoeqStzWaenqqRocFutMCvnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hailey-bieber-s-vacation-aesthetic-is-both-frilly-and-sexy.html><span>←</span><span>Hailey Bieber's Vacation Aesthetic Is Both Frilly and Sexy</span></a>
