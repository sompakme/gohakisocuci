Certain rappers build a legacy that ends up being so complex, it's truly hard to define. In fact, each&nbsp;and every generation features artists that help shift the course of rap&nbsp;permanently, making it&nbsp;hard to remember the days from before&nbsp;our current climate. To that end, it's easy to forget how much of the past two decades in rap music have been characterized by the domination of Atlanta, a city that’s produced some of the greatest rappers in the genre's history.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Biography, Age, Height, Parents, Nationality, Boyfriend, Net worth &amp;amp; More</h2><time>Aug 12, 2024</time>

Luckily, there's no need to play around with the spoiled jug of milk that's been in the back of your fridge for months.
