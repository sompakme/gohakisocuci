Mother, mother ocean, I've heard you call
Wanted to sail upon your waters
Since I was three feet tall
You've seen it all, you've seen it allWatch the men who rode you
Switch from sails to steam
And in your belly you can hold the treasures
Few have ever seen
Most of them dream
Most of them dream
Yes, I am a pirate two hundred years too late
Cannons don't thunder there's nothin' to plunder</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mac Davis Texas In My Rear View M</h2><time>Sep 8, 2024</time>

I was just fifteen and outta control
Lost to James Dean and rock and roll
I knew down deep in my country soul
That I had to get awayHollywood was a lady in red
Who danced in my dreams
As I tossed in bed
I knew I'd wind up
In jail or dead
If I had to stay
I thought happiness
Was Lubbock, Texas
In my rear view mirror
My momma kept calling me home</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Alec Baldwin Posts Photo with Newborn Son, Shares Nickname</h2><time>Sep 8, 2024</time>
