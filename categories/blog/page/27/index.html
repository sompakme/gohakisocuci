Answer
The average cost of a gravel driveway of 16×38 feet is $1,500. It is estimated that the basic cost per square foot will be between $0.25 and $0.80. Driveways on the smaller side may be installed for as low as $300, while a bigger and longer driveway can cost as much as $60,00,000.
It’s also important to know how much it costs to construct a road. In rural locations, it will cost around $2 million to $3 million per mile to build a new 2-lane undivided road; in metropolitan areas, it will cost approximately $3 million to $5 million per mile.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How to Make Cast-Iron Skillet Roast Stuffed Cabbage | Easiest Stuffed Cabbage Ever | Rachael Ray</h2><time>Sep 13, 2024</time>
