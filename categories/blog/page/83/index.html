It's always an event when DJ Khaled drops. Surely, he was aiming to dominate another summer with the release of&nbsp;KHALED KHALED and the many hits that it boasts. The star-studded cast that joins the project includes OGs in the game, like Jay-Z and Nas, to the new generation of stars like Lil Baby and Roddy Ricch. However, it's Khaled's latest leap into the world of dancehall that remains the strongest efforts on the project.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Geneva auto show closes shop after 119 years</h2><time>Aug 6, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../geneva-auto-show-closes-shop-after-119-years.html></a>
The more than century-old Geneva International Motor Show will be cancelled for good following waning interest from automakers in what was once an unmissable industry event, organisers said Friday.
The Qatar edition of the event, however, will continue and take place again in 2025.
The first Geneva auto show took place in 1905, attracting 17,000 visitors and had two more editions before a hiatus due to an economic crisis and World War I.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How can I make my electric scooter faster?</h2><time>Aug 6, 2024</time>

Rappers collaborate so much and so often these days through so many different modes (meetings, collabs, performances, social media mentions, etc.) that it's rare for two artists to not really have many common links. Regardless, that didn't stop Quavo and Ice Spice from having a good time at a bowling alley with friends, as a video recently surfaced of the two taking a picture together at the venue. Of course, it's unclear whether they just ran into each other or all went out together, so some gossip will likely stir.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jeff Dye is furious at Kristin Cavallari for telling his DUI story for clicks</h2><time>Aug 6, 2024</time>

It seems Jeff also wants to know why she‚Äôs talking about him ‚Äî or possibly he does know ‚Äî because Jeff thinks Kristin brought him up in an effort to get ‚Äúclicks.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lisa Ann Walter Net Worth</h2><time>Aug 6, 2024</time>
