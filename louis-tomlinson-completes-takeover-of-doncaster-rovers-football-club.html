"For me, <strong>this is all about the football</strong>, the community and restoring the excitement and desire to making Doncaster Rovers the most exciting club to play for in Yorkshire," wrote Louis in a statement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/023c52a9f5ac-louis-tomlinson-shirts-z.jpg><p id=exTeL3navYyq data-wc=5><strong>Louis Tomlinson and John Ryan</strong></p><p id=e1WTODcDdbfG data-wc=74>"I want to see the Doncaster Rovers supporters get the club the success it deserves.

While businessman John is the lesser known of the two men, he is expected to take a more hands-on approach to the running of the club, of which he was a chairman for 15 years. Louis will instead have to prioritise his commitments with One Direction, performing around the UK, Europe and across the world.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
