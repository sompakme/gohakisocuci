Chris added that the profile which had uploaded Sarkodie's song on Apple Music may have monitored Sarkodie's way of releasing his music on streaming platforms.</p>"Sarkodie releases his songs on YouTube and later uploads them on Apple Music and other streaming platforms. His song Advise, for instance, was released on YouTube and, after a while, on Apple Music and other streaming platforms. I think the person who uploaded the song had studied Sark's way of releasing his songs and knew that he would upload it later on Apple Music, giving him an advantage.
