According to her <a href=#>biography</a>, as a child she spent time in France where the family had rented a house. In 1910 she followed her mother to Cairo, where she spent three months at the lavish Gezirah Palace Hotel. She fell in love with Egypt, which became the set of several of her novels, including her first unpublished work, Snow Upon the Desert&nbsp;in&nbsp;1910, the successful Death on the Nile&nbsp;in 1937, and the experimental work Death Comes as the End&nbsp;in 1944, which <a href=#>The Conversation</a> describes as, "a marriage between archaeology, Egyptology and fiction writing."</p><p dir=ltr>In 1914 she married her first husband Archibald Christie, an aviator of the Royal Flying Corps. The couple had a daughter, Rosalind Margaret Clarissa, Agatha's only child. According to <a href=#>Agatha Christie</a>, in 1922, as her work was gaining momentum, the couple left their daughter in the care of Agatha's sister and mother and set about on a worldwide tour to promote the British Empire. During this time Agatha visited South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Canada. She wrote many letters to her mother detailing the places and people she encountered, which would eventually become the characters and sets of her novels. As her grandson, Mathew Prichard, later recalled, she was a "person who listened more than she talked, who saw more than she was seen," per <a href=#>her website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Fk3Fubm5fqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2WtKLAx5pknKCinsC1tcRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-a-list-workout-gwyneth-paltrow.html><span>←</span><span>The A List Workout: Gwyneth Paltrow</span></a>
