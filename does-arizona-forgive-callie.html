In Capshaw's final episode, Arizona admitted she couldn't stop smiling while texting Callie about the move. But the couple's relationship status has yet to be confirmed by the show.<h2>Do Callie and Arizona get back together after Arizona cheats?</h2>However, their relationship suffered when Arizona lost one of her legs during a plane crash. In season 9, Arizona cheated on Callie, and the couple separated. Although they attempted to get back together, a therapy exercise they considered splitting up for good in season 11.<h2>Does Callie and Arizona break up again?</h2>The Calzona relationship reached a breaking point<p>Though Callie initially resisted it, she eventually reached her breaking point.

Torres survives, and agrees to marry Robbins. After twelve weeks of recovery, both Torres and baby Sofia are discharged and allowed to leave the hospital.<h2>Callie & Arizona 12x24</h2><p></p><h2>Why does Arizona win custody of Sophia?</h2>The reason Arizona won that custody battle is because she was the better person to raise Sofia. Callie decided to run off to New York with her girlfriend of a few months and thought it would be fine to drag her child across the country, away from all her friends, away from her school, and away from her other mom.<h2>Does Callie get remarried after Arizona?</h2>After an on-again off-again relationship, she befriends and begins sleeping with Dr. Mark Sloan, AKA "McSteamy." Despite their "friendship with benefits" Callie reconciles with George and they get married in Las Vegas.<h2>Does Arizona cheat on Callie twice?</h2>Did anyone not realize that Arizona ended up cheating twice?

Callie suffers an accident. Callie gives birth to a girl and takes time to recover. Callie and Arizona get married.<h2>Does Callie return to Seattle Grace?</h2>Meredith thinks about it for a long time and then tells Thatcher that she doesn't know what it's like to have a father, but now she knows what it's like to have a sister and it's good. He accepts her liver and the surgeries go smoothly. Callie is given her job back as an attending at Seattle Grace.<h2>Why does Arizona blame Callie?</h2>Arizona ended up having her leg amputated because of the injuries from the crash. She blamed Callie for this, despite the fact that the surgery was necessary to save her life. That struggle nearly drove them apart. But their relationship seemed to be healing and reconnecting when something else tested them yet again.<h2>Does Arizona cheat on Callie with Leah?</h2>Here's the good news, when Arizona cheated on Callie, that was a huge betrayal and a deception in its grossest most horrible form. She did something horribly, horribly wrong. Her relationship with Leah — obviously people are going to debate it — but that's not that. It's not this gross deception or betrayal.<h2>Who wins the custody battle between Callie and Arizona?</h2>Ultimately, the custody battle becomes a huge issue that involves multiple doctors from the hospital testifying. At the final courtroom showdown between Callie and Arizona, Callie loses custody of her daughter — which causes a slew of problems between Callie and Penny, her new girlfriend.<h2>Does Owen adopt Ethan?</h2>Owen secretly wanted to adopt Ethan, unbeknownst to him, so he rather abruptly broke off their friendship once it became clear that Ethan would be able to stay with his dad.<h2>Do Callie and Arizona get back together in season 12?</h2>Callie started dating Penny and wanted to move to New York with her, but after a custody battle with Arizona over their daughter, Sofia, she broke up with Penny.

How does she respond? Watch this scene from Grey's Anatomy Season 11, Episode 20: One Flight Down.<h2>Does Arizona Robbins have one leg in real life?</h2>Does Arizona Robbins really have a prosthetic? Jessica doesn't have a prosthetic leg in real life, but in the show, they make it seem like she does thanks to ~magic~. She tweeted back in 2014, “In [Season 9, Episode 6: “Second Opinion”] I was walking on a prosthetic with my own leg tied behind me.<h2>How did GREY's Anatomy make Arizona look like an amputee?</h2>The Grey's Anatomy team hired A Step Ahead Prosthetics to create the “realistic-looking, high-heeled transfemoral prosthesis” for Arizona. The medical lab designed and built a special prop leg with a harness for a non-amputee.<h2>Why was Callie Torres fired?</h2>In early season four, Callie gets fired from her gig as chief resident when Richard figures out that Miranda was doing her work. She's not kicked out of Seattle Grace, though. Callie is eventually glad that it frees up her time to work on actual surgeries.<h2>Does Callie ever see Sofia again?</h2>They also insinuate that Arizona abandons her daughter to attend to official duties. However, the judge is lenient and grants Arizona full custody over Sofia despite Callie being the biological mother. Arizona is a considerate parent and allows Callie to see her daughter in a shared custody arrangement.<h2>Does Dr Torres lose the lawsuit?</h2>The case was ultimately ruled in Callie's favor.<h2>Who gets custody of April and Jackson's baby?</h2>It was during season 12 that April and Jackson agreed to raise their child together as friends. From the few episodes Harriet appeared in since April left Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, it is evident that the couple continues to share custody of their daughter amicably.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OonKxlkae2u7vNmmSfp6KctrexjJyYpaSZmg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./destiny-2-fans-use-glorbo-to-trick-ai-written-websites.html><span>←</span><span>Destiny 2 fans use Glorbo to trick AI-written websites</span></a>
