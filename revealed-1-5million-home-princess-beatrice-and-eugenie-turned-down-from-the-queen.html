But they never moved in."</p><p id=eAoyakVSOYuA data-wc=30>He also explained how its owners had renovated the house: "They reconfigured the staircase and updated the house throughout, moving the kitchen so it overlooks the garden and swimming pool."</p><p id=e5AdO0SdCw8p data-wc=23></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
