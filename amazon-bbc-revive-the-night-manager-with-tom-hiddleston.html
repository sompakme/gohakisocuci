Series creator David Farr is also set to return as writer. Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie, who starred in the first season, will also be executive producers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Ink Factory (The Little Drummer Girl, The Pigeon Tunnel) is producing The Night Manager in association with Character 7, Demarest Films and 127 Wall. The series is a co-production with Spain’s Nostromo Pictures. Georgi Banks-Davies (I Hate Suzie, Paper Girls) will direct all six episodes of season two.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“The first series of&nbsp;The Night Manager&nbsp;was one of the most creatively fulfilling projects I have ever worked on,” Hiddleston said in a statement. “The depth, range and complexity of Jonathan Pine was, and remains, a thrilling prospect. I’m so looking forward to reuniting with [The Ink Factory’s] Simon and Stephen Cornwell, David Farr and [EP] Stephen Garrett, and to working with Georgi Banks-Davies to tell the next chapter of our story. I can’t wait.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Night Manager first aired on the BBC in the U.K. and AMC in the United States and followed Jonathan Pine (Hiddleston), a former British soldier and night manager of a hotel in Cairo who’s recruited to help take down an arms dealer (Laurie). The first season also starred Olivia Colman, Tom Hollander and Elizabeth Debicki. It was nominated for 12 Emmys and won two (including one for director Susanne Bier) and also won three BAFTA TV awards.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“John le Carré’s work has long been an inspiration to me and working closely with him on season one was an honour and a pleasure. I did not tread lightly into extending&nbsp;The Night Manager&nbsp;beyond the original book, but an idea came to me a couple of years ago which felt truthful to that unique world of dark corners and shady identities,” said Farr. “No one marries the suspense&nbsp;of espionage with a deep&nbsp;exploration&nbsp;of the human soul quite like le Carré. I hope that in some way we can pay homage to his uneasy genius in this new&nbsp;exploration. I am thrilled to be working again with Tom Hiddleston, Stephen Garrett and The Ink Factory team, and to be welcoming the brilliant director Georgi Banks-Davies&nbsp;into our ranks.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The series will air on BBC One and iPlayer in the U.K. and Prime Video in the rest of the world. Fifth Season, which negotiated the deal, is handling worldwide distribution.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Farr, Hiddleston, Laurie, Simon and Stephen Cornwell, Garrett and Banks-Davies executive produce The Night Manager with Joe Tsai and Arthur Wang for 127 Wall; Michele Wolkoff and Tessa Inkelaar for The Ink Factory; Adrián Guerra for Nostromo Pictures; William D. Johnson for Demarest Films; and Nick Cornwell, Susanne Bier, Fifth Season’s Chris Rice and the BBC’s Gaynor Holmes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Hiddleston is repped by Hamilton Hodell in the U.K., UTA, Johnson Shapiro and Prosper PR. Farr is repped by UTA in the states and Curtis Brown Group Ltd. in the U.K. The estate of John le Carré is repped by Curtis Brown Group Ltd. Banks-Davies is repped by LARK, Independent Talent Group and CAA.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOmqSasp%2BjeqOuwmaroZ1do7aotNNmpJqmkZyys3nTqKRmoJmZsa2x0q2mp2VhZ4B2hJZqcGxrXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./654-angel-number-meaning-and-symbolism.html><span>←</span><span>654 Angel Number Meaning and Symbolism</span></a>
