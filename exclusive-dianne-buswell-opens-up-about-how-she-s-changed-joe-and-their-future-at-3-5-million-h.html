"We're just trying to make it more cosy and more homely every day." She added: "I have to tell you a little secret, Joe's actually such a good interior designer."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d8b6ef304208-joe-sugg-dianne-buswell.jpg><p id=emBGJIW1O-6 data-wc=29>The ultra-luxe mansion used to belong to Premier League footballer, Lewis Dunk, and boasts six reception rooms, a double staircase, an open-plan kitchen and lounge overlooking the huge garden.</p><p id=eQ4YP1Xh44c data-wc=40>But that's only the beginning, what cannot go unnoticed about the lavish property is how many features are dedicated to health and wellness, as the home also features a gym, a heated pool, an ice bath, and an infrared sauna.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3db4b36d1172-diannebuswell17106851873325790861484636294215162868.jpg><p id=emtCW6u8N4C data-wc=39>Talking about the installation of her ice bath and sauna, Dianne confessed that one of the ways she has "changed" Joe since they got together is how she's made him more aware of how to live a healthier lifestyle.</p><p id=eQ00ADJQF1I data-wc=21>"I think I've really changed Joe a little bit in that sense because he probably wasn't as aware of these things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e5a606e029fa-diannebuswell17106851873325790861493175487215162868.jpg><p id=e9MhOR-W1yj data-wc=40>Talking about their ice bath she said: "He gets in there and he puts his little Beanie on and he loves it. I must admit I stay in the ice bath for longer, but it's a bit of a competition!"</p><p id=efNzvYrZGF5 data-wc=27>Dianne confessed that her healthy instalments into her new home all stem from her wanting to stay fit and able to dance as long as she can.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ba0135eeaaf7-dianne-buswell-checkerboard.jpg><p id=eb2Ce6g89QP data-wc=32>"I think coming from where I wasn't very well at one point, it made me realise, I want to dance forever, I want to be 80 still feel good in my body."</p><p id=eW6ouEBVbT2 data-wc=41>It isn't just her body that she has been keeping in excellent shape, as she has recently teamed up with New Nordic, a brand which Dianne cites as the reason she has gotten the glow back into her skin and hair.</p><p id=er6tE-N89Nm data-wc=16>"I find the New Nordic routine really simple.

He loves a little face mask," she added. "He's&nbsp;great with his skincare and I think it's really good for guys to get more into their skincare but maybe they are afraid to say it -I'm all for it!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/53d42f229941-dianne-buswell-parents-sunset.jpg><p id=e1F3vIPhhKxt data-wc=53>As an Australian native, Dianne frequently visits her sun-soaked home, and we can't help but wonder if she is ever tempted to move back, or anywhere else for that matter. But she confirmed she's very happy with her new life in Brighton, and it looks like that is where they will be staying.</p><p id=e2D5WYk4Hg4N data-wc=38>"We really love it where we are.
