Anderson alleged that when she met with Seagal about the movie, he explicitly offered a sexual quid pro quo.&nbsp;"I remember him saying to me, 'If you don't do it, then that girl across the hall will do it, and she'll get the job,'" Anderson told&nbsp;<a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "And I said, 'Well, good, goodbye.'"</p><p>At the time, Anderson was among Hollywood's hottest celebrities, thanks to roles in two hit television series ("Home Improvement" and "Baywatch") and her record-setting number of Playboy covers. However,&nbsp;her keen intuition allowed her to miraculously avoid any #MeToo moments on the so-called casting couch with the likes of Harvey Weinstein and other Hollywood predators. "You need to have that Spidey sense or whatever it is that this is not right," she said, noting that preventing herself from entering precarious situations had a lot to do with common sense. "When someone answers the door in a bathrobe, don't go in that room," she explained.</p><p>The "Under Siege"&nbsp;role&nbsp;ultimately went to Erika Eleniak, whose career path was remarkably similar to Anderson's, in that Eleniak posed naked for Playboy and also starred in "Baywatch."&nbsp;In fact, Eleniak left "Baywatch" just as Anderson arrived.&nbsp;"My exit was Pamela Anderson's entrance," Eleniak told <a href=#>Fox News</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
