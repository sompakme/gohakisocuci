Yuri - Stabbed herself in the stomach and chest while under Monika's control; was later revived by Monika. Natsuki - Erased from existence by Monika; was later revived by Monika.</span></span><h2>How long does Yuri's death last?</h2>Yuri's body is left decomposing for three days, and is then discovered by Natsuki, who immediately vomits and runs away.<h2>Who is the killer in Doki Doki?</h2>Monika (in Japanese: モニカ) is the main antagonist of the 2017 visual novel Doki Doki Literature Club!, serving as the overarching antagonist of Act 1, the overarching-turned-final antagonist of Act 2, the main antagonist of Act 3 and the deuteragonist of Act 4.<h2>What is the true ending in DDLC?</h2>If you choose to delete her, the game will reset without her and Sayori will become the new president of the Literature Club. Monika will then step and prevent the events from repeating and just delete everyone, lamenting that there's no joy to be found in the Literature Club.<h2>Does DDLC have an ending?</h2>RELATED: Doki Doki Literature Club: How To Get The Normal Ending Despite the unavoidable events in the game, there's a good ending, also known to be the special ending — it's a happy ending version of the game and the players will receive a special letter from Dan Salvato, the genius behind Doki Doki Literature Club.<h2>Doki Doki Literature Club! Natsuki death scene</h2><p></p><h2>Why are Sayori's hands bloody?</h2>Her neck didn't break causing her to slowly choke to death, but as Monika said:''She seemed to change her mind about killing herself'' cause she started clawing at the rope around her neck trying to set herself free, which is why she has blood on her hands.<h2>What happens if I don't delete Monika?</h2>Not just in another room, but after she herself has deleted the rest of the game. If players don't delete Monika at this stage in the game, they will only be able to speak to Monika when they return.<h2>What happens if you tell Sayori I love her?</h2>When Sayori confesses her love for the protagonist, she will either hug him or run away with a pained expression (depending on the player's choice). The next day, the protagonist will go to school without her, assuming she was still asleep.<h2>What happens if you delete Monika early?</h2>If the player decides to delete Monika from the game, Monika will then glitch out, before becoming disembodied and angrily expressing her disgust at the player. She will then claim that she made a mistake and express her regret at what she has done to her friends.<h2>Are there Jumpscares in Doki Doki?</h2>There are no "real" sudden jumpscares which trigger your basic instincts. ^ Also, the above scene is 100% missable. You need to focus on a specific character during a specific part of the game. Yes, however, as Flustered stated, they're limited.<h2>Is Monika a trap?</h2>After finishing the game, i have come to a conclusion that what Monika did is too complicated technologically and emotionally (deleting the other girls). As such, Monika must be a trap (secretly male).<h2>How do I delete Monika?</h2>The game brings the player one-on-one with Monika as she sits there and stares at you. The only way to get rid of her is to delete her character file.<h2>Can you save Sayori?</h2>Unfortunately, the answer to the question of whether you can save Sayori in Doki Doki Literature Club Plus is no, you cannot. No matter what decisions you make in the game, Sayori's death will not change.<h2>How did Monika know my name?</h2>if not, Monika just simply read your name which you use on your computer. In my situation i have Administrator,aaaand...she called me one. if not, Monika just simply read your name which you use on your computer. In my situation i have Administrator,aaaand...she called me one.<h2>Can you date Yuri DDLC?</h2>To date Yuri, pick dark, mysterious words in your poems. Yuri likes poems about melancholy, grief, disasters, and anxiety. Anything related to death and scars will make Yuri happy.<h2>Is Monika a Yandere?</h2>Character. Monika is a Isolationist and Manipulative Yandere; introduced as the Literature Club president, she is very driven and goal focused with a passion for poetry and music.<h2>Can DDLC break your computer?</h2>No, it's perfectly safe. does it do anything rather than edit its own files? Nothing changes except the game, it only uses certain info at a certain part of the game. Nothing personal, nothing that you hid and it somehow knows, it's actually something easy to get to.<h2>How does Monika know you're recording?</h2>Monika's Jump-scare<p>During Act 3, if the player has OBS or XSplit running in the background during the part where Monika says the player's PC name, instead of that dialogue appearing, she will notice that she's being recorded and after a short talk will jump-scare the player.</p><h2>Can Monika hack your computer?</h2>It's safe. Don't worry. It's all part of the experience but it's entirely safe, that I can assure you. it bypasses your computer and directly hacks your brain.<h2>Who dies first in DDLC?</h2>Victims. Sayori - Hung herself while under Monika's control; was later revived by Monika. Yuri - Stabbed herself in the stomach and chest while under Monika's control; was later revived by Monika.
