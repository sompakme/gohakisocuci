Now Lionsgate will begin anew with its own take.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“When you have enjoyed the strong creative collaboration and success that we have had working with Francis, you want to repeat that experience as much as possible,” said Joe Drake, chair of the Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. “We couldn’t be more excited about reuniting with him on&nbsp;The Long Walk.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a truly unparalleled talent.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">First published under the author’s pseudonym Richard Bachman, The Long Walk centers on an annual contest in which 100 teen boys embark on the punishing titular journey that involves strict stipulations (they must walk at least four miles an hour) and ends with only one survivor. Over the years, such filmmakers as George A. Romero and Frank Darabont had eyed the project.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The book’s influence can be felt in later works, including Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games novel series. This makes Lawrence an appropriate fit, given that he helmed the franchise’s 2013 sequel The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and the subsequent Mockingjay two-parter. Lawrence returned to Panem with the recent prequel, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, which stars Tom Blyth, Rachel Zegler and Peter Dinklage and has <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>topped the domestic box office</a> in its first two weekends.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Lawrence — whose other previous titles include Red Sparrow (2018) and Slumberland (2022) — confirmed his involvement in The Long Walk during a recent interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Business Insider</a>. Additionally, he has been <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>developing sequels</a> to his movies Constantine (2005) and I Am Legend (2007) and is attached to Netflix’s live-action adaptation of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>video game franchise BioShock</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Mollner wrote and directed the 2016 indie Western film Outlaws and Angels that starred Chad Michael Murray and Luke Wilson. &nbsp;Most recently, he wrote and directed Strange Darling, a thriller that premiered at Fantastic Fest in September.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Meredith Wieck and Erin Jones-Wesley will oversee The Long Walk for Lionsgate. Lawrence is repped by CAA, 3 Arts, and Hansen Jacobson while Mollner is repped by UTA, World Builder Entertainment and Jackoway Austen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLTAxKmfnqZdoLavs4ytn55lnKS7qHnWmqOkZZyevK%2B%2FxpqrnmWWp66vr8isZKWZp6eyr6%2FEZmhra2VrhXSBlmtm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rev-al-sharpton-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Rev.
