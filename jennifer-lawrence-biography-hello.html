The star has two older brothers, Ben and Blaine. Known as Jen in her family, the actress displayed her strong motivation for the performing arts from a young age. At 14 she convinced her parents to take her to New York to audition for talent agencies.&nbsp;</p><p id=enklxZ30haZ data-wc=51>Keen for their daughter to have an education, Jennifer's parents wouldn't let her break into the industry until she had graduated from high school. However, after an attempt from her mother to have her enter the modeling world, Jennifer dropped out of high school aged 14 without a GED or diploma.</p><h2>Jennifer Lawrence's Rise to Fame</h2><p id=eXzNQSoLc_ data-wc=58>It was in New York City that the teen was discovered by a photographer. Her photo was taken on the street and she was subsequently called in for an audition for an advert. Despite not winning the part, she was signed with the CESD talent agency, who convinced her parents to let her audition for roles in LA.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezoi2a7cE4 data-wc=51>Her first job came in the form of a commercial for MTV's My Super Sweet 16, which led to other ads for big names such as Burger King and appearances in TV series. However, television wasn't enough for the teenage star, and she rapidly set her sights on the big screen.</p><p id=eRFVVCi_6Y data-wc=58>In 2008 alone, Jennifer starred in Garden Party, The Burning Plain and Poker House. Her performance in the latter earned her the Outstanding Performance Award from the Los Angeles Film Festival. Her part in The Burning Plain opposite <a class=hm-link href=#>Charlize Theron</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Kim Basinger</a> also earned her an award for Best Young Emerging Actress at the Venice Film Festival.</p><h2>Jennifer Lawrence's Success</h2><p id=eaU-ckgsPo data-wc=49>Her portrayal of a unflinching 17-year-old struggling to keep her family together in a poor rural area as she hunts down her drug-dealing father in 2010's Winter's Bone is the role that has been cited as her "breakout performance." The film earned her a Golden Globe and Oscar nomination.</p><p id=e0BdzCR7xEt data-wc=49>She struck gold again in 2013, winning an Academy Award for Silver Linings Playbook. Away from the screen, she was a breath of fresh Kentucky air in Hollywood, becoming a beloved star thanks to her candid take on interviews, relaxed public appearances, and the desire to appear more "normal."</p><p id=enbAJz3iPR data-wc=29>However, her biggest commercial successes came as the leads of the X-Men franchise as Mystique and Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games franchise, starting in 2011 and 2012 respectively.</p><p id=eBLUXaWLIk0 data-wc=34>Her other prime credits include 2014's American Hustle, 2016's Joy (both of which garnered her Oscar nods), 2016's Passengers, 2017's mother!, and 2021's Don't Look Up. Her latest release is 2023's No Hard Feelings.</p><h2>Jennifer Lawrence's Personal Life</h2><p id=euvluDTl8fAn data-wc=36>While the star tends to keep her personal life away from the public eye, her high-profile friendships and relationships have brought her significant attention, specifically her close bonds with the likes of <a class=hm-link href=#>Emma Stone</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Adele</a>.</p><p id=e4sfjvZUMP data-wc=48>She was in a relationship with X-Men co-star Nicholas Hoult from 2010-2014, and dated filmmaker Darren Aronofsky from 2016-2017. In 2018, she began a relationship with art gallery owner Cooke Maroney, with the two discreetly tying the knot in 2019. <a class=hm-link href=#>They welcomed their son Cy in February 2022</a>.</p><p id=eA_u-De4fBm data-wc=9>For more on Jennifer Lawrence, check out more&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>here</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV%2BcnyRaW5ycWVkt6a6zaKdnqpdoa64vsSnmp5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-do-i-fix-bald-spots-on-my-eyelashes.html><span>←</span><span>How do I fix bald spots on my eyelashes?</span></a>
