According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">ESPN</a>, his knee required an MRI earlier this season and has also been drained and received injections. Wall, 27, underwent another MRI on Monday and later visited orthopedic surgeon Richard D. Parker, who will perform the "clean up" procedure today. Parker also performed two knee surgeries on Wall in May 2016, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">ESPN</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At&nbsp;27-22, the Washington Wizards are currently sitting in sixth place in the Eastern Conference, though they're just two games up on the eighth seeded Philadelphia 76ers.
