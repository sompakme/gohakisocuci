Former Warner Records artist Phora almost lost his life back in 2011 when he was viciously stabbed and four years later, he was shot at while in a vehicle with his then-girlfriend. The 2015 incident resulted in Phora sustaining injuries to his back and neck from three bullets. Days ago, it's reported<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">&nbsp;Phora and his Yours Truly team</a> were the victims of a drive-by in a puzzling event that occurred as they were making their way to Las Vegas for a meet and greet.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The shooting reportedly took place on Wednesday (March 3) and Phora shared a brief clip to his Instagram Story that concerned fans. It only lasts a few seconds but&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the rapper is heard</a> asking if the passenger in a yellow Lamborghini is okay as the person&nbsp;is seen bleeding.

"Last night Phora and members of the Yours Truly team were shot at on the highway while headed to Las Vegas for a meet and greet.
