Bilson admitted in 2018 to <a href=#>People</a>, "We're still kind of trying to figure it out...It's a tricky one. And I don't know that there is any right way, necessarily." She added that Briar was too young to totally understand her parents' split. Bilson explained, "We say Mommy has a house and Daddy has a house but she's pretty young to have an in-depth conversation."</p><p dir=ltr>Bilson suggested that at the time, her and Christensen couldn't let their feelings toward each other impact Briar. Bilson said, "No matter what I'm dealing with or how much it hurts or how much anger there is, it's just about her." She added, "She has that love that is unconditional so I think we're doing okay."</p><p dir=ltr>It seems that Christensen and Bilson eventually ironed out their co-parenting routine. Bilson revealed to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in 2021, "It's been going pretty well," adding, "It's also nice because you're stuck in the house [amid the pandemic]. So, for her to have another house to go to, I think that's actually been helpful. So, all in all, it's been good." Bilson revealed the secret to their happiness to <a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;the same year, saying, "Communication is key and just being on the same page, so everything's about the kid. As long as you put the kid first, everything will be okay."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbnBjboF4e9OhnGasopa7tLLOq6SarJmku267xWafmrGUmrtur8eroKyslaPAprqMn6mopV1mf27AzmZraWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-disney-crime-western-series-is-90s-greatest-show.html><span>←</span><span>The Disney+ Crime Western Series Is 90s Greatest Show</span></a>
