We cut the legs off of our pants
Threw our shoes into the ocean
Sit back and wave through the daylight
Sit back and wave through the daylightSlip and slide on subway grates

Some color on monochrome
Maybe I'll paint them in myself</article><article class=post-entry><h2>'It was like I'd written it for myself'</h2><time>Jul 20, 2024</time>
