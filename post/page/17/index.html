<a href=../../../did-jesus-have-a-bloodline.html></a>
There is no evidence that these beliefs derived from the much earlier Gnostic traditions of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, but the Cathar traditions did find their way into many of the 20th-century popular writings claiming the existence of a Jesus bloodline. Are there any descendants of Jesus? Probability theory tells us, however, that if Jesus had any children, his biological line would almost certainly have either died out after relatively few generations, or else would have grown exponentially so that many millions of people alive today would be direct descendants of Jesus.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Donald MacDonald Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Sep 20, 2024</time>

With eight days to go till the Bill Blass show, I was deep into a green-grape diet (three for breakfast, two for snacks, six for binges). How else was I going to fit into my assigned skintight showstopper? I was a model on a mission. But given that I was also a robust 6'2", wedging myself into munchkin minis was no picnic. Somewhat inevitably, I collapsed in New York's Chelsea Hotel and was carried past the jaded bohemians to the nearest hospital.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Fernando Valenzuela Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Sep 20, 2024</time>
