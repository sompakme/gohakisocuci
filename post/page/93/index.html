Verse 1
This goes out to the worried
This goes out to the stressed
Sorting out a million thoughts
Running through your head
Verse 2
To everyone that's waiting
For better days ahead
Tired and frustrated
And leaving words unsaid
Pre Chorus
Please don't hold your breath
Chorus
Just breathe
'Cause it's a miracle
We can breathe
There's power in the way
That we breathe
Release your heavy burdens
And let everything that has breath</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Gail Bean Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Jul 30, 2024</time>
