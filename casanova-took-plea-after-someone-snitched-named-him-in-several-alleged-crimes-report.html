Casanova recently shared that he <a href=# rel>agreed to a plea deal </a>after facing charges related to alleged gang activity with the Untouchable Gorilla Stone Nation.

One gang member said on a call that they were worried that Senior’s behavior “would potentially <a href=# rel>tarnish his rap career,</a>” Felton claimed.
