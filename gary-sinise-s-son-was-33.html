Like any family experiencing such a loss, we are heartbroken and have been managing as best we can. As parents, it is so difficult losing a child. My heart goes out to all who have suffered a similar loss, and to anyone who has lost a loved one. We’ve all experienced it in some way. … I am so blessed, fortunate, and proud to be his dad.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Mac was diagnosed with Chordoma in August 2018, just two months after Gary’s wife Moira was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. After months of treatment, the Forrest Gump actor said Moira went into remission and has been cancer-free since, but even after several surgeries, his son’s cancer continued to spread.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“This began a long battle that disabled him more and more as time went on,” Gary wrote. “The cancer fight was getting harder, but throughout most of 2019 he was still able to come to the GSF [Gary Sinise Foundation] office, until a third spine surgery in November of that year.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Mac had a passion for music from a young age, learning to play the drums at 9 years old. He later graduated from the USC Thornton School of Music, where he studied songwriting and composition. He also played piano and harmonica, and occasionally served as drummer in Gary’s band the Lt. Dan Band.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Apollo 13 actor said cancer eventually paralyzed his son from the chest down, but that didn’t stop him from wanting to create music. Mac ended up working on an original composition, “Arctic Circles,” thanks to help from fellow musicians Dan Myers, Ben Lewis, Oliver Schnee and Bill Schnee, as well as playing harmonica on a recording of “Shenandoah.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The collaboration eventually expanded to an entire album titled&nbsp;Resurrection & Revival, which had a “theme of bringing something that was old or unfinished back to life.” The album also featured members from the Lt. Dan Band.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“He gave his family and friends so much during his 33 years, and he accomplished great things in those final months,” Gary Sinise added in his<a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.garysinisefoundation.org/mac-tribute> tribute</a>. “Thank you, Mac. You did it.&nbsp;Resurrection & Revival&nbsp;will live on. And so will you. In our hearts forever. We were blessed to have you in our lives as son, brother, and friend…and we will miss you and love you for eternity.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Gary Sinise said Mac Sinise: Resurrection and Revival will be available soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofK6vwpqlp5ldlru1tM6nsGarmaO2tLGMnZyanF2crrPFjKygp6GjmsBuv86nZKato56wqq3NZmhra2VtgHiFkW1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eddie-hearn-bio-age-height-net-worth-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Eddie Hearn bio: age, height, net worth, wife</span></a>
