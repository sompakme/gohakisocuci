The Mattel brand has recreated some of the artist’s best archived makeup moments from over the years on actual Barbie dolls. From a Lion King-inspired look as an ode to his Disney collab, to a spread in <i>Glamour</i> with Soo Joo Park, these dolls have a whole new look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So why Barbie?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Barbie’s always been on a mission to inspire young boys and girls,” Sir John tells <i>InStyle. </i>“She’s a strong woman who has had so many different careers. She runs parallel, because also all my clients are really, really strong women, and they move the needle in culture and society.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The special dolls were created by Mattel with the help of Sir John to make sure every look was exactly right — with not a hair or lash out of place. The dolls were then shot in a studio to create very glamorous photographs to show off their makeovers.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mattel</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mattel</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mattel</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mattel</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mattel</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the dolls will not be for sale, they were created in celebration of everything Sir John stands for: inclusion and representation in beauty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Right now, we’re in an era where representation matters,” says Sir John. “I grew up in an era where we couldn’t always see ourselves in toys. So what I love about the place that we’re in now, is that all kids are able to dream on the same level. That imagination that we’re trying to induce isn’t deflated, and it’s all adjacent to as much creativity as they can muster up or hold within their little brains.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Beyoncé Calls to End SARS As Protests Continue in Nigeria</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This collection and these archived looks also stand for Sir John's belief that makeup works to highlight something that comes from within.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Makeup is a vehicle to show who you are,” the makeup artist says. “Beauty is a feeling, it comes from the inside. And you know, makeup is, it’s an expression of who we are. That emotional connection that you have with cosmetics because they do change your sense of self it helps to stand for something, which is more than just some kind of topical aesthetic journey, it’s a soul search. It’s leaning into yourself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The collection will be published on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@BarbieStyle</a> Instagram page starting Dec. 16.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCqvoyjpqGmXZeus67InmSmmZuavLex0Q%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./atar-scores-young-aussies-film-their-reactions-to-hsc-results.html><span>←</span><span>ATAR scores: Young Aussies film their reactions to HSC results</span></a>
