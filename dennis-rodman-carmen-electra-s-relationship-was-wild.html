One topic that came up in that episode, and in other moments in the series, was Rodman's relationship with Playmate and&nbsp;Baywatch&nbsp;star Carmen Electra in the late '90s.</p><p>Electra and Rodman met a nightclub in Los Angeles, and the basketball player quickly became smitten. "We exchanged numbers, and he would call and call and call," Electra said to<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/4/29/21241568/last-dance-bulls-carmen-electra-recalls-courtship-with-dennis-rodman referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>&nbsp;the&nbsp;Chicago Sun-Times</a>.

"He [Rodman] was very humble. He threw a mattress in front of the couch in the living room. That's where he always slept. That's where I slept as well. We were both naked, actually, when there's a knock at the door, Dennis jumps up, I don't know if he answered the door naked or not, I can't remember that part because I was hiding. He just turned around to me and said,' It's Michael Jordan. I've got to go practice.'"</p><p>The crazy stories don't stop there.

"He blindfolds me, and we get on his motorcycle. When he finally takes my blindfold off, we're standing at the Bulls' practice facility, center court. It was crazy, like two kids in a candy store. We were eating popsicles from the fridge and pretty much having sex all over the damn place—in the physical therapy room, in the weight room. Obviously on the court. To be honest, I don't think he's ever worked out so hard in his life." So, like, the most normal date of all time?</p><p>The pair were so enamored with each other that they, like many of our&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/g22108600/celebrity-couples-pda-moments-photos/>favorite celebrity couples</a>, got hitched in Las Vegas. On November 14, 1998, Rodman and Electra eloped at Chapel of the Flowers, only to file for annulment nine days later. They reconciled but ultimately divorced in April of 1999.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

There will never be another one like it."</p><p>Today, the pair don't speak often, despite having the same agent. The documentary has reminded Electra what a special time that was, she says.

A lot of struggles," she said to the&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/04/29/carmen-electra-recalls-dennis-rodman-dennis-was-considered-the-bad-boy-of-basketball-and-i-like-bad-boys/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Associated Press</a>.
