WWE Hall of Famer Rikishi recently took to Instagram to reveal that <a href=#>his fourth son, Thamiko T. Fatu, is open to bookings</a>, sparking rumors that he might join The Bloodline.</p><p>Although it is unclear if WWE has approached Fatu with a contract, this could be a significant opportunity for the wrestling dynasty to deepen its impact on the industry and the WWE Universe. If Fatu were to join The Bloodline, he could add extra depth and lethality to the faction and be an aide to Roman Reigns.</p><p>The Bloodline, led by <a href=#>Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns</a>, has constantly been expanding. It started with Jey Uso, followed by Jimmy Uso and finally, The Usos’ youngest brother, Solo Sikoa. During this time, Heyman was there as the Special Counsel, whereas Sami Zayn was incorporated as an Honorary Uce.</p><p>Jeremiah Fatu, also known as Toko Uso, was born on August 30, 1986, and has stayed away from the pro-wrestling world until now. Despite never making any pro-wrestling appearances, Fatu once appeared on WWE RAW back in 1997. His segment was with Santa Claus and him calling out the imposter. It was mistakenly believed to be either Jey or Jimmy Uso who made that appearance. Ryan Pappolia clarified that it was, in fact, Jeremiah Fatu.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>It remains unknown why Fatu decided to enter the pro-wrestling world, but this could open up several opportunities for The Bloodline’s future storylines.</p><p>The addition of Toko Uso to The Bloodline could further solidify the faction’s dominance in WWE. Fans will have to wait and see if this potential addition comes to fruition and if it will change the landscape of WWE’s storylines.</p><p>What do you think about the possibility of Toko Uso, joining The Bloodline faction in WWE? Do you believe his addition could deepen the faction’s impact in WWE?
