They'll even set it up so the business shows up on Google Maps, <a class=body-link href=#>the <i>Daily Dot </i>reported.</a></p><p>The company is based in the US but it is looking for employees in Australia, Canada and the UK in order to expand its services. It also provides landlord references.</p><p>Founder William Schmidt set up the website in 2009 after being made redundant during the global financial crisis.</p><p>"While we were all unemployed, a couple of my former co-workers asked me to act as their reference for job interviews," Mr Schmidt said. "I did it for free for my friends, but then I realised that this is something there's a pretty big demand for. It was something I could take to the public."</p><p>He responds to questions about the ethics of proving fake job references by saying that many of his clients were treated badly by former employers and were therefore unable to get references.</p><p>CareerExcuse does not provide references linked to real companies and it will not lie about skills that could put lives at risk.</p><p>"Yes, there's a moral issue in fibbing on your resumé to land a job, but that's for people to deal with themselves," he said. "In today's environment with rampant unemployment, everyone's looking for an edge. Our service just gets them the interview."</p><p>###</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyjwdKipZ6ro2TBpq%2FHp6alp5eufKSt0Z6cq52omMK0scKopGaooqTDqrDErGSfmZuaequ7wWapnp6Vp7Kvr8SsZKimnJ67pnvNnq6sZaOpvLPFjnFum5pjbIN4fsOfbZ5uZpexeLDBa5xra5SYg3iwxGlu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-vanessa-lyon-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Vanessa Lyon? | Wiki, Age, Bio, Net Worth, Career, Relationship,Family</span></a>
