In an act of remarkable heroism, Francia Raisa, a longtime friend of Gomez’, donated her kidney.

"He’s 16 pounds. That was rough. I couldn’t walk him.” Apparently, she could not even handle minor household tasks. Pictures from the surgery can still be found on Gomez’ Instagram. Check out these pictures she posted with Raisa.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Since then, it seems the two have drifted apart, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Radar Online</a>. A source close to the two has told the website, “They haven’t talked at all since October.” It is also noteworthy that neither seems to have celebrated the other’s birthday on social media. This has been a common occurrence in years past.&nbsp;</span>The source did not reveal what has led to the rift but hopefully neither hold any animosity towards each other. Maybe one day their friendship will be on stronger grounds.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
