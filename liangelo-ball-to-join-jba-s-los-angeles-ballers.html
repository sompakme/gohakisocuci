That's all I want to do, win. I'm trying to play ball and I'm trying to get better every day." His younger brother LaMelo added, "It's all business. If you're not playing hard, you get sent home. They brought in Gelo while he's been working out at home. This is the JBA, you have to come to play. I love playing with my brother, we have great chemistry. It feels good to play with him again."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The league is comprised&nbsp;of eight teams based&nbsp;in major cities throughout the country including Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia, Seattle, Dallas, New York, Houston, and Los Angeles.
