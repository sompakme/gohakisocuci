<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Madison Bumgarner Wife, Salary, Net Worth, Height, Weight</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Madison Bumgarner is an American professional baseball pitcher who plays for the San Francisco Giants. A World Series champion and Most Valuable Player, MadBum is often considered one of the best players in the world of sports, which has helped him create buzz every time his name is mentioned among fans.</span></p><h3><strong><span>Madison Bumgarner Quick Bio</span></strong></h3><p><span>The baseball superstar was born Madison Kyle Bumgarner on August 1, 1989 in Hickory, North Carolina. But then it was in an area known as&nbsp; </span><span>Bumtown</span><span> &nbsp;that he was raised. The city is nicknamed so because many people have the same last name as the baseball player.</span></p><p><span>He was kind of born with a natural talent for the sports he is known for today, as he started playing at an early age. By the age of 4, Madison had already started playing with people much older than him and he was doing very well. Luckily for him, he had a very supportive father.</span></p><p><span>For his education, he went to South Caldwell High School in Hudson, North Carolina. Here he got to play the game he loved and made a name for himself after watching the team become champions in the 2007 4A State Championship.</span></p><p><span>Thanks to his accomplishments, he was named by the North Carolina High School Athletic Association as one of the “100 Athletes Not to Lose” in 2013. What makes this event even more interesting is the fact that people like Michael Jordan are on the listing.</span></p><p><span>Professionally, Madison started with the San Francisco Giants when he was drafted in 2007 and in 2008 he was pitched for the Augusta Greenjackets. In 2009, he was called up as a major player by the San Francisco Giants and it would be the start of a successful career that would see him win three titles: Major League Baseball World Series Champion, 4 Stars in the National League and World 1 in Major League Baseball. Series Most Valuable Player Award, among others.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His Salary&nbsp; </span></strong><strong><span>and&nbsp; </span></strong><strong><span>Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>A very hardworking person who has made a good name for himself, Madison Bumgarner has earned a good amount of money over the years and his net worth is estimated at $25 million. In 2016, he had an annual income of 9.75 million USD in salary.</span></p><p><span>The main way Bumgarner makes his money is from his sports. The San Francisco Giants star signed a six-year contract extension with the team in 2012, which would see him stay with the team until 2018. The contract value was $35.56 million. More so, for 2018 and 2019, the contract is open for an additional $12 million before he becomes a free agent in 2020. Another thing that came with the signing was a $1 million bonus . His annual salary since 2017 is $12 million.</span></p><p><span>With this earnings, it’s obvious that as far as net worth is concerned, the star has already ticked the box perfectly. That’s especially since he’s also had his fair share of endorsement deals, including his&nbsp; 2014 </span><span>MadBum</span><span> &nbsp;campaign for the Jockey underwear line after winning the World Series Most Valuable Player award. .</span></p><h2><strong><span>Madison Bumgarner’s&nbsp; </span></strong><strong><span>wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>Madison Bumgarner has always been romantically associated with one woman throughout her career and even before. That woman is Ali Saunders. Since she is his wife, her name is now Ali Bumgarner. Before he started dating her, however, he revealed that he had been dating another girl whose name was Madison Bumgarner.</span></p><p><span>The baseball player and Ali Saunders were dating high schoolers in western North Carolina until 2010 when they decided to tie the knot. They got married on Valentine’s Day this year. The ceremony was private and uncomplicated. It is said again and again that shortly after their marriage, Bumgarner bought a cow for his wife.</span></p><p><span>Madison and Ali Saunders, who have been together for almost 10 years and married for nearly 10, do not yet have children.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height and width</span></strong></h2><p><span>As a sportsman, it’s no surprise that Madison Bumgarner has an athletic build that will help her succeed in most other sports, not just baseball.</span></p><p><span>He is 1.9m (6ft 5in) tall which not only makes him taller than his wife but also many others. Its weight is 250 pounds (110 kg).</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGilkZm2tLvNZpmupZeWv6%2Bx0Wauop6VYsCiuMCrsGamlal6uLvRrZ9moJWetKnAjLCcop%2BYqXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mac-to-honour-aaliyah-with-make-up-line-after-fan-petition-goes-viral.html><span>←</span><span>MAC to honour Aaliyah with make-up line after fan petition goes viral</span></a>
