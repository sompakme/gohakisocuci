After reuniting in the Season 8 premiere last week (and exchanging some serious flirtation this week), the former travel buddies sleep together in the halls of Winterfell as they await what may be their final days.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Arya, the bold fighter that she is, is the one who makes the first move. After having Gendry forge a special weapon for her (a spear with dragonglass edges), she asks him about the other women he's been with. He says there were three. Then he reveals he's Robert Baratheon's bastard son.</p><img alt="Darkness, Scene, Screenshot, Movie, Leather, Fictional character, " title="Darkness, Scene, Screenshot, Movie, Leather, Fictional character, " width=3155 height=2100 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/helen-sloan-hbo-13-1555901175.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One thing leads to another, and ultimately, she gets to the point: They might as well get together considering they might not be alive for much longer. "If we’re going to die soon I want to know what that’s like before that happens," she says before they hook up.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The scene took the Internet by surprise. How old are Arya and Gendry anyway? Isn't she still a child? Arya is said to be about 11 in the first season of GoT, which would make her 18 now, while actress Maisie Willams is 22 in real life. Gendry's age was never confirmed onscreen, but <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/How-Old-Arya-Gendry-Game-Thrones-46035200 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=PopSugar class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">PopSugar</a> points out that in the books, he's about 16 when the story begins, making him about 23 now. Meanwhile, actor Joe Dempsie is 31 years old.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Viewers were simply shook over the scene. Some even cheered Arya on.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some weren't comfortable watching the scene, considering how young Arya was when the events of GoT began.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Others simply trolled the moment in the best way.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Arya and Gendry might've had their sweet moments together in tonight's episode, but will they make it out of the upcoming battle against the dead and continue their romance? We're worried.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Game of Thrones airs Sundays at 9 P.M.</strong><strong></strong><strong> EST on HBO.</strong></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
