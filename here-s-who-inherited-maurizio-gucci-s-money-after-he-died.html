Four others, including her friend and psychic, Pina Auriemma, were also arrested. Despite maintaining her innocence, <a href=#>Biography</a> writes, Reggiani was nicknamed the Black Widow by the Italian media. It was widely known that she detested her ex-husband and often spoke about wanting him dead. Per <a href=#>The Guardian</a>, Reggiani's daughters, Alessandra and Allegra, then ages 16 and 20, respectively, fully supported their mother.</p><p dir=ltr><a href=#>Newsweek</a> explains that they believed that a previous brain tumor surgery had clouded their mother's judgments. It was later reported that Allegra went as far as studying law to help her mother's case. Per <a href=#>StyleCaster</a>, Reggiani was found guilty of Gucci's murder in 1997. She was sentenced to 29 years in prison but served only 18. According to <a href=#>People,</a> Reggiani was released in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>As for Alessandra and Allegra, the <a href=#>South China Morning Post</a> states that they inherited $400 million from their father, along with two yachts, named Creole and Avel. The sisters were also given properties in New York, Milan, and Switzerland. Now in their 40s, Alessandra and Allegra prefer life out of the limelight. They both reportedly live in Switzerland with their spouses and children. In a 2016 interview with The Guardian, Reggiani stated that she had barely spoken to her daughters since her release from prison. She went on to say that they were no longer financially supporting her and that she had yet met to meet her grandchildren.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEk2prcWlfnbKzsdJmrqGnXZ67qbHRoquenF2irra%2ByLOgqGWXqrCktdJmpKimla56orLTnqlmoJVisaqxw2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./devin-mccourty-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Devin McCourty Net Worth 2024</span></a>
