Or rather, that used to be the case. As <a href=#>CNN</a> tells us, in January 2020 the Prince of Darkness told the world that he has the PRKN 2 form of Parkinson's disease, so he may eventually succumb to the inevitability of time after all.&nbsp;</p><p>The reveal, which Osbourne described as "a weight being lifted,"&nbsp;followed a long period of concert date cancellations and many rumors that the artist was basically on his deathbed. While this doesn't appear to be quite true, Osbourne did say that 2019 was pretty much the worst year of his life,&nbsp;thanks to a serious fall he took and a number of other health troubles, such as a bad infection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of this shocking reveal, the 71-year-old rocker feels that people shouldn't count him out yet. As his wife, Sharon Osbourne, put it: "It's not a death sentence by any stretch of the imagination, but it does affect certain nerves in your body. It's like you have a good day, a good day and then a really bad day." Here's hoping for more good days.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k29uam1fpMe7xYyoqpunpae7pr%2BMraman5mYerOxwKVkpaGWmnq0wM6rsGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicki-minaj-poses-with-brooke-bailey.html><span>←</span><span>Nicki Minaj Poses With Brooke Bailey</span></a>
