I understand that the Organised Private Sector says they can only pay ₦60,000 a minimum wage but let them bend over backwards."<h2>Accusations of political games by NLC</h2><p class=align-left>Omokri argued that if the government made this higher offer and the NLC continued to insist on the ₦494,000 demand, it would expose the NLC's stance as politically motivated rather than based on realistic economic conditions.</p><p class=align-left>HE explained:</p>"If they make that offer and the Nigerian Labour Congress still insists on their unrealistic ₦494,000, then Nigerians will see that the government have done their best and the NLC is only playing political games and will shift their support away from the NLC," he explained.<h2>Periodic wage adjustments</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4e48566d988b8ce8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“This reality must be factored into the negotiations”: Tinubu’s govt appeals to organised labour</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Omokri also emphasized the importance of adjusting the minimum wage periodically to account for inflation, suggesting a biennial review.</p><p class=align-left>HE averred:</p>"The ₦75,000 should not be fixed. It should be adjusted every two years to take into account inflation.
