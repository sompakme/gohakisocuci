As noted by <a href=#>Independent</a>, one of the songs, <a href=#>"Energy,"</a> samples Kelis' single&nbsp;<a href=#>"Get Along With You."</a> The track was taken from her debut album, <a href=#>"Kaleidoscope,"</a>&nbsp;produced by The Neptunes.</p><p dir=ltr>Kelis expressed that she hadn't given Beyoncé or The Neptunes permission to sample the song and didn't know about the situation until a fan page shared the news on Instagram. As soon as she found out, Kelis took to the comments section on her food account to reveal how she really felt. "My mind is blown too because the level of disrespect and utter ignorance of all 3 parties involved is astounding. I heard about this the same way everyone else did," <a href=#>she wrote</a>. "Nothing is ever as it seems, some of the people in this business have no soul or integrity and they have everyone fooled."</p><p>Fifteen hours ago, Kelis shared a video to her main <a href=#>Instagram</a> account and went into more detail as to why she was annoyed. Even though Pharrell Williams has songwriting credits on a lot of Kelis' songs, she claims he "never wrote a song and lyric a day in his life" and believed he did this a direct hit at her. As for Beyoncé, Kelis insisted she is aware that the singer has copied her before, but believes she should have had the "common decency" to contact her for permission.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmxlaYRye8qeo6KrXZa7pXnBnrCoppOawG6yxK6bZp6lobm6ecSxp6WZmaOypXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeremy-lamb-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Jeremy Lamb Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents</span></a>
