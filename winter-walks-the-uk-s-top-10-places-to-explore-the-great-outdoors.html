So make sure to give yourself space to relax.</p><p>Whether you wrap up warm and head out for a few hours of peace and quiet, or bring along the children and dog to run off all that pent up energy, there's nothing quite like a crisp&nbsp;winter&nbsp;walk.&nbsp;Or perhaps – another year – you're a visitor from overseas and are looking for winter walks to enjoy during your stay?</p><p>We've rounded up some of the best walking trails and events to give you a spring in your step during the cold winter months!

While more seasoned walkers may wish to scale the heights of the area’s hills, the lakes also offer a wide range of lower-level walks, which although less challenging still offer stunning views of the natural landscape.&nbsp;</p><p>Flanked by the dramatic summits of Grasmoor and High Stile, Buttermere lake has a clearly defined path, making it a must-visit for walkers in the winter months.

The walk to the houses is a little challenging and can be muddy, so make sure you wear good boots.
