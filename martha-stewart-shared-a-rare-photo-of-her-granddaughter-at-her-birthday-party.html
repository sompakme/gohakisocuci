"Jude turned twelve this week and had a SPARTY! Get it??? Japanese food, spa robes&nbsp;#peressofmadisonavenue&nbsp;and beautiful skin care products from&nbsp;@mariobadescu&nbsp;lots of goodies for nails and toes from clients of PR wonder&nbsp;@alisobridmc&nbsp;They had fun. And didnt sleep a wink !!"<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jude was born <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>via surrogate in 2011</a> to mother Alexis Stewart, Martha's only daughter. Alexis later welcomed son Truman, who also recently celebrated his 11th birthday. Alexis is the daughter of Martha and Andrew Stewart. The two wed in 1961 before splitting in 1987.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2020 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>, Martha got candid about the trials and tribulations of raising her daughter. "At the time, Alexis was going to school in Westport, and I was commuting to New York. After I gave up stock-brokering, I started an at-home catering business, which was extremely time-consuming."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"One thing Alexis learned from that was how to cook. She's a phenomenal cook and baker. I tried to involve her in everything, but the minute she could leave home and go to boarding school, she did," she explained. "Our relationship has always been a difficult mother-daughter relationship. Difficult, but she would do anything for me, and I would do anything for her."<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And while Stewart is clearly a fabulous grandma who throws lavish and aesthetic spa soirées, she recently told InStyle that she doesn't identify as a coastal grandmother. "I mean, I am a grandmother,"&nbsp;she said. "I could never be in those [Nancy Meyers] movies. I work every day! I'm not retired yet, maybe when I retire in 20 years ... maybe."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJqpraCRYsC1sdaaqa1ll6eur7DDmqygoKSav26uyKuroZyRrnqxrdGtsGZvYmqBeYGX</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mac-miller-knock-knock-video.html><span>←</span><span>Mac Miller &amp;quot;Knock Knock&amp;quot; Video</span></a>
