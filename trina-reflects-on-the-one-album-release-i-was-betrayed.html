She detailed the controversy during an episode of Love & Hip Hop Miami.</p><p>"After four years, we finished the album, finally. Then, my business partner Julian was given a $300,000 advance and he used it for his label which was supposed to be for me," she said on the show in 2020. "Now, all of a sudden I'm getting cease and desist letters from producers that were never paid, and my whole album was taken down off the internet."</p><p>Artists often reflect on their records when release anniversaries arise, and Trina reflected on The One and the battles she faced with the record.</p><p>"[Three] years ago today [orange heart emoji][sad face emoji] I worked rlly hard on this project and it hurt me so bad how I was betrayed and taken advantage of . I rarely speak on things but this was suppose to be one of my happiest moments and it turned into one of my biggest pains. STILL .. #TheOne."</p><p>Her relationship with Julian was one of deep trust and Love & Hip Hop Miami fans watched as it unfolded on reality television.
