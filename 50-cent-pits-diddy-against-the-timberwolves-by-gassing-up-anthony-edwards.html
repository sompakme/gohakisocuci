In fact, they even chopped it up behind the scenes, with Edwards remarking to the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>G-Unit</a> mogul that he's "funny as hell" after a hug. Fif was happy to document everything on social media and share in the celebrations, and he couldn't help but <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">embrace tradition</a> and rope in a little <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Diddy</a> troll in the process.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Now puffy not gonna want to watch the game no more," 50 Cent captioned the clip of him embracing Anthony Edwards, calling to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his relentless bashing</a> of the Bad Boy mogul amid his various accusations of sexual assault, sex trafficking, and other crimes. This was a well-established feud before these allegations emerged explosively toward the end of last year. As such, we can't really say that this is surprising or unprecedented in any way. Yet it doesn't make 50's connections to the Diddy scandal any less outrageous or unwarranted, as he's finding pretty much any excuse to comment on it.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-50-cent-uses-anthony-edwards-meeting-to-further-troll-diddy-watch>50 Cent Uses Anthony Edwards Meeting To Further Troll Diddy: Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What's more is that this is also pitting the Queens native against other artists or celebrities who have come forward with a defense of Diddy. For example, he recently attacked <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jason Derulo</a> over his comments on the matter. "I believe in that. I believe in innocent before proven guilty," Derulo had told TMZ during an encounter. "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Shut the fvck up !</a> let me find out you on one of them tapes boy," 50 Cent captioned an Instagram post about these comments, making his stance on even third parties to this situation very clear.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ant-s-incredible-performance-see-fif-react-to-50-piece>Ant's Incredible Performance: See Fif React To 50-Piece</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, these attacks have also landed against the likes of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Meek Mill</a> and Yung Miami, and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">showed little mercy</a> when it comes to comically intended trolling. With all this in mind, all we can really hope for is that the dead horse gets beat in creative and new ways rather than just trolling for the sake of trolling. Then again, this is Curtis Jackson we're talking about.

Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.
