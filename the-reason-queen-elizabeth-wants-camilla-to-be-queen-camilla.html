Royal historian Robert Lacey told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> that the decision wasn't taken lightly, but drew upon feelings that came up with Philip's death and her own parents.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In the message, she was acknowledging her own mortality and looking to the future," he said. "As she thought about her father George VI, she would have also thought about her mother and the importance she played as a partner to him. And then, of course, with the passing of Prince Philip, she is considering the sacrifices and difficulties of being a consort."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Photo by Chris Jackson - WPA Pool/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Royal fans have been noticing hints of the news for years now. In 2016, the queen announced that Camilla would be a part of the Privy Council. Then, in 2021, Camilla became a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener nofollow">member of the Order of the Garter</a>, which People describes as "the most senior order of knighthood in the British honors system."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This was the big remaining question mark and it has now been resolved, and any consent from the Prime Minister of the day for the title is a formality," Lacey added. "Some people might have thought she would look backwards over her reign with this message, but she was in fact looking forwards in a positive way."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in 2005, when Charles married Camilla, many thought that she would take the title of princess consort when Charles became king. With the weekend's news, Elizabeth guarantees that Camilla will be crowned alongside Charles during his coronation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the queen's announcement, Charles <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener nofollow">released a statement</a> that acknowledged the importance of the decision.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We are deeply conscious of the honour represented by my mother's wish. As we have sought together to serve and support Her Majesty and the people of our communities, my darling wife has been my own steadfast support throughout," it read.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9CunJ6mXZq5qsbAm5ytoF%2BYrq61y6WYZqiRp7imvoybprCklah6ssHEnqVmm5%2BjwLC%2B02afoqukpL%2Bqrc1mqZ6Zo6S7tHnWobA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./see-jason-momoa-invade-dreams-in-slumberland.html><span>←</span><span>See Jason Momoa Invade Dreams In Slumberland</span></a>
